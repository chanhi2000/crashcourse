> Practice Rust with challenging examples, exercises and projects

This book was designed for easily diving into and get skilled with Rust, and it's very easy to use: All you need to do is to make each exercise compile without ERRORS and Panics !

## Running locally

We use mdbook building our exercises. You can run locally with below steps:

```sh
cargo install mdbook
cd rust-by-practice && mdbook serve 
```

## Features

Part of our examples and exercises are borrowed from [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/> Rust By Example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example), thanks for your great works!

Although they are so awesome, we have our own secret weapons

- There are three parts in each chapter: examples, exercises and practices
- Besides examples, we have a _lot of exercises_, you can Read, Edit and Run them ONLINE
- Covering nearly all aspects of Rust, such as async/await, threads, sync primitives, optimizing, standard libraries, tool chain, data structures and algorithms etc.
- Every exercise has its own solutions
- The overall difficulties are a bit higher and from easy to super hard: easy ðŸŒŸ medium ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ hard ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ super hard ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

__What we want to do is fill in the gap between learning and getting started with real projects.__
