> Assembly code generated from Rust for parameter passing

---

Here we will be exploring the performance implications of passing the `self` parameter by value, reference, and smart pointers (`Box`, `Rc` and `Arc`). The generated assembly code will help us understand what happens under the hood.

We will be working with the `Complex` struct defined below. The code shows how a struct and its associated methods declarations in Rust. Note that like Python, the `self` parameter that refers to the associated object is passed explicitly in the method declaration.

```rs
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::sync::Arc;

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct Complex {
    real: f64,
    imaginary: f64,
}

impl Complex {
    pub fn magnitude_self_copy(self) -> f64 {
        (self.real.powf(2.0) + self.imaginary.powf(2.0)).sqrt()
    }

    pub fn magnitude_self_reference(&self) -> f64 {
        (self.real.powf(2.0) + self.imaginary.powf(2.0)).sqrt()
    }

    // Passing smart pointers
    pub fn magnitude_self_box(self: Box<Self>) -> f64 {
        (self.real.powf(2.0) + self.imaginary.powf(2.0)).sqrt()
    }

    pub fn magnitude_self_rc(self: Rc<Self>) -> f64 {
        (self.real.powf(2.0) + self.imaginary.powf(2.0)).sqrt()
    }

    pub fn magnitude_self_arc(self: Arc<Self>) -> f64 {
        (self.real.powf(2.0) + self.imaginary.powf(2.0)).sqrt()
    }
}
```

The `self` parameter in a method can specify the expected ownership model for the object. The following table shows `self` with different ownership models used in the methods associated with the `Complex` struct.


| `Self` __type__ | Passed parameter (highlighted in green) | Implication |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `self` | ![Passing self by value](https://eventhelix.com/rust/rust-to-assembly-value-reference-box-rc-arc/self.svg) | By default, Rust assumes that a parameter passed by value is moved. The ownership of the parameter passes to the called function. In this example, however, the `Complex` type implements `Copy` and `Clone` traits. In this case, the compiler is copying the complete object to the method. |
| `&self` | ![Passing self by reference](https://eventhelix.com/rust/rust-to-assembly-value-reference-box-rc-arc/ref_self.svg) | The method is immutably borrowing the object. Here the compiler will pass the address of `Complex` object to the method. |
| `self : Box<Self>` | ![Passing self by a Box pointer](https://eventhelix.com/rust/rust-to-assembly-value-reference-box-rc-arc/box_self.svg) | `Box` is like the `unique_ptr` in C++. Here the object is allocated on the heap. The method gets complete ownership of the object and will cease to exist after the method returns. The memory would be released back to the heap. | 
| `self : Rc<Self>` | ![Passing self by a RC pointer](https://eventhelix.com/rust/rust-to-assembly-value-reference-box-rc-arc/rc_self.svg) | Here a shared smart pointer has been passed to the method. Multiple pointers to this object may be active in the same thread. The method will share ownership to `self`. The function will decrement shared reference counts stored along with the `Complex` object. If this was the only reference to the object, the object would be destroyed, and the memory would be released to the heap. If the reference counts do not go to zero, the object will live even after the method returns. |
| `self : Arc<Self>` | ![Passing self by a Arc pointer](https://eventhelix.com/rust/rust-to-assembly-value-reference-box-rc-arc/arc_self.svg) | Here a multi-thread safe `Arc` smart pointer is being passed to the method. The method will now own the `Arc` smart pointer. When the method goes out of scope, the shared reference counts saved along with `Complex` will be atomically decremented. If the reference counts reach 0, the object in the heap will be deleted. Note that the reference counts are now decremented using atomic read-modify-write operations. | 

Now let’s examine the assembly code generated for each method shown above. To aid in the understanding a flow chart as well as annotated assembly is presented for each method.

## Self is passed by value to the method

```rs
pub fn magnitude_self_copy(self) -> f64 {
    (self.real.powf(2.0) + self.imaginary.powf(2.0)).sqrt()
}
```

The assembly code generated for the above function is shown below. One interesting thing to note here is that the compiler has optimized the passing of the `Complex` object by storing the `real` and `imaginary` fields in `xmm0` and `xmm1` registers, respectively. The method computes the result, and the final return value is returned via the `xmm0` register. The following flow chart better illustrates this flow.

### Flow chart

<!-- TODO: mermaid로 변경 -->

### Assembly code

```armasm
; The compiler has optimized the code to pass the real and 
; imaginary parts in the xmm0 and xmm1 registers.
example::Complex::magnitude_self_copy:
        mulsd   xmm0, xmm0  ; Square the real part
        mulsd   xmm1, xmm1  ; Square the imaginary part
        addsd   xmm1, xmm0  ; Add the two squared numbers and store the result in xmm1
        xorps   xmm0, xmm0  ; Clear xmm0. This will zero out the upper bits of the reg.
        sqrtsd  xmm0, xmm1  ; Perform the square root on the squared sum and store in xmm0
        ret                 ; Return to the called with the result in xmm0
```

---

## Self reference &T is passed to the method

```rs
pub fn magnitude_self_reference(&self) -> f64 {
    (self.real.powf(2.0) + self.imaginary.powf(2.0)).sqrt()
}
```
A reference to self (`&self`) has been passed in the above function. Here the address of the `Complex` object is passed to the method via the `rdi` register. The generated code then accesses the `real` and `imaginary` parts via a vector operation. The squaring of the numbers is also performed as a vector operation in `xmm0`. The vector results are then unpacked into the `xmm1` and `xmm2` registers. The `xmm1` and `xmm2` registers are then added together and the result is stored in `xmm1`. The square root of the result is then computed and stored in `xmm0`. The final result is returned via the `xmm0` register.

### Assembly code

We see that the compiler has generated very different code for the `&self` method compared to the `self` method. In the `&self` method, the compiler has to copy the real and imaginary parts from the memory. The compiler, however, makes up for this loss of performance by using vector operations to perform the squaring and addition of the numbers.

```armasm
; The caller will pass the pointer to the Complex struct in the rdi register.
example::Complex::magnitude_self_reference:
        movupd      xmm0, xmmword ptr [rdi]    ; Vectorized load of the real and imaginary parts
        mulpd       xmm0, xmm0                 ; Square the real and imaginary parts (vectorized)
        movapd      xmm1, xmm0                 ; Vectorized copy of the real and imaginary parts to xmm1
        unpckhpd    xmm1, xmm0                 ; Unpack the real and imaginary parts into xmm1 and xmm0
        addsd       xmm1, xmm0                 ; Add the real and imaginary parts
        xorps       xmm0, xmm0                 ; Clear the complete xmm0 to 0
        sqrtsd      xmm0, xmm1                 ; square root of xmm1 -> xmm0
        ret                                    ; return xmm0
```

## Self points to the object on the heap via Box

```rs
pub fn magnitude_self_box(self: Box<Self>) -> f64 {
    (self.real.powf(2.0) + self.imaginary.powf(2.0)).sqrt()
}
```

A `Box` smart pointer to self is being passed here. The `Box` contains a pointer to the `Complex` object stored on the heap. The following table shows the heap representation.

| Byte offset | Field | Field size in bytes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | `Complex` value | 16 |

The generated assembly code looks like the `&self` case. This happens because the method owns the `Box` that points to the `Complex` on the heap. Once the method exits, the self `Box` will go out of scope. The `Box` smart pointer will then free the associated memory (The `Box` in Rust is like the `unique_ptr` in C++).

### Flow chart

![Assembly code overview for passing self as a Box smart pointer](https://eventhelix.com/rust/rust-to-assembly-value-reference-box-rc-arc/box-self-calculate-magnitude.svg)

<!-- TODO: mermaid로 변경 -->

### Assembly code

```armasm
; The caller stores the Complex object on the heap.
; The heap address is passed in the rdi register.
example::Complex::magnitude_self_box:
        push        rax                         ; Preserve the current value of rax on the stack.
        movupd      xmm0, xmmword ptr [rdi]     ; Vectorized load of the real and imaginary parts
        mulpd       xmm0, xmm0                  ; Square the real and imaginary parts (vectorized)
        movapd      xmm1, xmm0                  ; Vectorized copy of the real and imaginary parts to xmm1
        unpckhpd    xmm1, xmm0                  ; Unpack the real and imaginary parts into xmm1 and xmm0
        addsd       xmm1, xmm0                  ; Add the squared real and imaginary parts
        xorps       xmm0, xmm0                  ; Clear the complete xmm0 to 0
        sqrtsd      xmm0, xmm1                  ; square root of xmm1 -> xmm0

        ;♻️This method owns the Box. Now that the function is about to return so 
        ; the Box is going out of scope and is about to be dropped.
        ; Dropping here means that the heap memory allocated for the Complex object
        ; can now be freed. Note that the rdi register already points to the memory that
        ; needs to be freed.
        movsd       qword ptr [rsp], xmm0       ; Save xmm0 on the stack
        mov         esi, 16                     ; Size of the memory to be freed (Complex is 16 bytes)
        mov         edx, 8                      ; The data is 8-byte aligned.

        ; The parameters to the de-allocation function are:
        ; rdi : Address of memory to be freed
        ; esi : Size of memory to be freed.
        ; edx: Alignment of the memory to be freed.
        call        qword ptr [rip + __rust_dealloc@GOTPCREL]   ; The parameters to the de-allocation function are:
        movsd       xmm0, qword ptr [rsp]       ; Restore the xmm0 from the stack. This is the return value.
        pop         rax                         ; Restore the value of the rax register
        ret                                     ; Return the result in xmm0
```

## A reference-counted smart pointer `Rc` to self is passed

```rs
pub fn magnitude_self_rc(self: Rc<Self>) -> f64 {
    (self.real.powf(2.0) + self.imaginary.powf(2.0)).sqrt()
}
```

The above method is designed to take ownership of `Rc`, a reference counting smart pointer. The `Rc` points to the following data on the heap:

| Byte offset | Field | Field size in bytes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | `strong` reference count | 8 | 
| 8 | `weak` reference count | 8 | 
| 16 | `Complex` value | 16 |

When a `Rc` is created it starts with the strong reference count set to 1. If a `Rc` is cloned, it does not copy the pointed data, it just increments the reference count. This way multiple shared references may point to the same heap memory. Also, when a `Rc` is dropped, the reference count is decremented. If the reference count falls to 0, the memory block on the heap is de-allocated.

The generated assembly code looks like the `&self` case. The major differences are due to `Rc` reference count decrement handling. Notice that the offsets for the access of the `real` and `imaginary` parts are 16 and 24, respectively. This is due to the two 64-bit reference counts that are present before the `Complex` object.

Once the `real` and `imaginary` parts have been saved in `xmm1`, the reference counts are decremented in preparation of the method going out of scope. If the reference count hits zero, the object pointed from the `Rc` will be deleted. If not, the memory block containing the reference counts and `Complex` objects live as there are other Rc smart pointers pointing to the same memory block.

::: tip Note

We have ignored the weak reference in this discussion.

```

## An atomic reference counted shared reference Arc to self is passed

```rs
pub fn magnitude_self_arc(self: Arc<Self>) -> f64 {
    (self.real.powf(2.0) + self.imaginary.powf(2.0)).sqrt()
}
```

`Arc` is a smart pointer that operates across threads. This requires that reference count increments and decrements are atomic. An atomic read-modify-write operation is performed to manage reference counts across threads.

The `Arc` smart pointer points to a heap allocation that contains `AtomicUsize` strong and weak references. The `Complex` object is stored after the two references (see the following table for the memory representation).

| Byte offset | Field | Field size in bytes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | `AtomicUsize` strong reference count | 8 |
| 8 | `AtomicUsize` weak reference count | 8 |
| 16 | `Complex` value | 16 |

The code generated for `Arc` is similar to the code generated for `Rc`. The significant differences from the `Rc` assembly code are:

- `lock sub qword ptr [rdi]`, 1 is generated for handling the atomic decrement of the reference count.
- The drop check and weak reference count decrement are handled in `alloc::sync::Arc<T>::drop_slow` function.

## Key takeaways

### For small types copying the object might be more efficient  than passing a reference

In our analysis, the most efficient code with the least memory overhead was generated for the `Complex::magnitude_self_copy` method. From small types, passing by value might be more efficient than passing a reference.

###  Passing a &T is efficient

In most scenarios, passing a reference will be more efficient than passing by value as the compiler will not need to copy the entire contents to the called function.

###  Passing a Box will result in object de-allocation

Passing a `Box<T>` will result in the object being de-allocated. If this is not the desired behavior, then pass a `&T` or `&mut T` instead.

### Prefer passing a &T over Rc and Arc when the function just  wishes to read from T

From the generated code we see that passing an owned `Rc<T>` and `Arc<T>` introduce significant overhead. Prefer passing a reference `&T` in scenarios where no sharing changes are expected.

The [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/lfxy6b/pass_arct_by_clone_or_by_reference) on the subject defines the following rules for `Arc<T>`:

- If a function always needs to own its own copy of the `Arc`, pass `Arc<T>` directly by value. The caller can decide whether to clone or move an existing `Arc` into it.
- If the function just very rarely needs to make a copy of the `Arc`, `&Arc<T>` can make sense so that you are not forced to do atomic operations in the common case, at the cost of not being able to just move the arc in the uncommon case.
- If the function just wants to read from the `T`, just pass `&T`.

###  Consider the memory overhead of `Rc` and `Arc`

On a 64-bit machine, `Rc` and `Arc` add a 16 byte overhead on the heap.
