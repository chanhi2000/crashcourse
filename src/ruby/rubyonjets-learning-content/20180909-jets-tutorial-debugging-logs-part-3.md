In this video, we continue the tutorials on the [Jets Ruby Serverless Framework](http://rubyonjets.com/) that adds Ruby support to AWS Lambda. We’ll cover something that is pretty important to know as a software developer: debugging. With Jets it’s pretty straightforward to look at the debugging logs both locally and remotely. Locally, the logs show up with the local running server. Remotely, the logs show up in CloudWatch Logs: available both on the AWS CloudWatch Logs console and the AWS Lambda console.

- Checking out the log output locally
- Breaking the App Remotely by calling raise "`my kids`"
- Deploy the App
