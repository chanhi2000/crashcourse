[Jets](http://rubyonjets.com/), a Ruby Serverless Framework, makes use of [API Gateway Binary Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-content-encodings-examples.html) to make uploading images and files from AWS Lambda a straightforward task. Weâ€™ll cover how to upload images or any file with [Jets](http://rubyonjets.com/) and [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave`](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) in this tutorial guide. Note, please use Jets v1.3.1 and above for this tutorial guide as the jets new generator was updated for it. Hereâ€™s the [Live Demo](https://upload.demo.rubyonjets.com/) of this tutorial. The full source code is on Github: [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`tongueroo/jets-example-upload`](https://github.com/tongueroo/jets-example-upload).

## Brand New App

Create a brand new Jets app with scaffolding.

```sh
gem install jets
jets new upload
cd upload
jets generate scaffold Post title:string photo:string
vim .env.development # edit with local db settings
jets db:create db:migrate
jets server
```

The app has a Post model with title and photo fields. 

![You should be able to now go to [http://localhost:8888/posts](http://localhost:8888/posts), create a Post record, and see something like this](https://blog.boltops.com/img/posts/2018/12/upload-posts-index.png)

---

## Update form

The starter scaffold provided us with basic CRUD abilities. However, the form does not handle uploading files yet. Weâ€™ll modify it so it does. Do the following to add a file input field:

- Update the form with `multipart: true`
- IMPORTANT: Get rid of the: `<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put" />` 
- For multipart form data, we need to route the request and POST to the resource.
- Replace `<%= text_field_tag "post[photo]", post.photo %>` with `<%= file_field_tag "post[photo]" %>`

The form html should look something like this:

```html
<%= form_tag(action, multipart: true) do %>
  <div class="field">
    <%= label_tag :title %>
    <%= text_field_tag "post[title]", post.title %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= label_tag :photo %>
    <%= file_field_tag "post[photo]" %>
  </div>
...
```

Hereâ€™s the full source code of the [form](https://github.com/tongueroo/jets-example-upload/blob/master/app/views/posts/_form.html.erb).

Upload the form again and youâ€™ll notice that a text field value gets save to something like this now: `#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x00007fbe42cd1948>`

By changing the form to send multipart data, the controller now receives an `ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile` object. The `#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x00007fbe42cd1948>` is a String representation of the file handle. Weâ€™re getting closer. This is the first step to getting image uploads working.

---

## Enter Carrierwave

Now weâ€™ll add the `carrierwave` and `fog-aws` gems to save the actual uploaded data instead of just a text String representation of the upload. Add the following to your Gemfile:

```gemfile
gem "carrierwave", git: "https://github.com/tongueroo/carrierwave.git"
gem "fog-aws" # to use s3 as the storage backend
```

::: tip Note

weâ€™re using a [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>fork of Carriewave](https://github.com/tongueroo/carrierwave) which adds Jets support via [Turbines](http://rubyonjets.com/docs/jets-turbines/).

:::

```sh
bundle install
jets generate uploader Photo
#
#       create  app/uploaders/photo_uploader.rb
```

Enable the uploader by overriding the Post model photo setter and getter methods with `mount_uploader`.

> <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-folder"/>`app/models/`<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-advanced"/>`post.rb`:

```rb
require 'carrierwave/orm/activerecord'

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  mount_uploader :photo, PhotoUploader # overrides photo
end
```

---

## Change CarrierWave to S3 Storage

By default, the generated CarrierWave uploader persists the upload to the filesystem. In the Serverless world, this doesnâ€™t make sense. Instead, weâ€™ll configure the uploader to save to s3.

Open up <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-advanced"/>`photo_uploader.rb` and make sure that `storage: fog` is used instead of the default `storage: file`.

```RB
class PhotoUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  storage :fog # we want to use the fog backend for s3 support
  # ...
end
```

Add an <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-folder"/>`config/initializers/`<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-advanced"/>`carrierwave.rb`:

```rb
CarrierWave.configure do |config|
  config.fog_provider = 'fog/aws'
  config.fog_credentials = {
    provider:              'AWS',
    aws_access_key_id:     ENV['CARRIERWAVE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
    aws_secret_access_key: ENV['CARRIERWAVE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'],
    # use_iam_profile:       true,                         # optional, defaults to false
    region:                ENV['CARRIERWAVE_AWS_REGION'],
  }
  config.fog_directory  = ENV['CARRIERWAVE_S3_BUCKET']
  config.fog_public     = true                                                  # optional, defaults to true
  config.fog_attributes = { cache_control: "public, max-age=#{1.hour.to_i}" } # optional, defaults to {}
end
```

CarrierWave uses itâ€™s own homegrown AWS client internally instead of the aws-sdk and currently does not support the use of `AWS_PROFILE`. So weâ€™ll need to create an IAM user and generate AWS access key for it. For the instructions to create AWS access keys refer to these docs: [How do I create an AWS access key](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/)?

Next, create the s3 bucket:

```sh
aws s3 mb s3://demo-uploads-$(date +%s)
#
# make_bucket: demo-uploads-1544733003
```

Weâ€™re using `date +%s` to just add a timestamp to the bucket name. Note the S3 bucket name in my case is `demo-uploads-1544733003`, yours will be different.

Add these values to the [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-file"/>`.env.development`](http://rubyonjets.com/docs/env-files/) file so they get picked up by <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-folder"/>`config/initializers/`<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-advanced"/>`carrierwave.rb`. You can use a different .env.production file for different settings like an s3 bucket. Weâ€™re working only with <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-file"/>`.env.development` for the sake of this tutorial.

It should look something like this:

> <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-file"/>`.env.development`:

```
CARRIERWAVE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAI7KI5LIKEXAMPLE
CARRIERWAVE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XOGuscz2lNyGFo1ChFntigzBp3IMMGdEXAMPLE
CARRIERWAVE_AWS_REGION=us-west-2
CARRIERWAVE_S3_BUCKET=demo-uploads-1544733003 # remember yours will be different
```

## Test CarrierWave

Now weâ€™re ready to start the server and test real uploading with CarrierWave:

```sh
jets server
```

Go through the [http://localhost:8888/posts](http://localhost:8888/posts) form again and upload an image. 

![https://blog.boltops.com/img/posts/2018/12/upload-posts-show-text.png](This time you should see that the photo field has an s3 url. Something like: `https://demo-uploads-1544733003.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/post/photo/1/jets.png`)

Letâ€™s change the show page so that the photo shows up, change the photo ERB line to `<%= image_tag(@post.photo) %>`. The code should look something like this:

> <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-folder"/>`app/views/posts/`<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-advanced"/>`show.html.erb`:

```rb
<p>
  <strong>Photo:</strong>
  <%= image_tag(@post.photo) %>
</p>
```

![The posts show page now looks like this](https://blog.boltops.com/img/posts/2018/12/upload-posts-show-image.png)

We have successfully uploaded an image to s3 locally! ðŸŽ‰

## Deploy to AWS Lambda

Before deploying to AWS Lambda, adjust your <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-file"/>`.env.development.remote` to point to an RDS database. Setting up an RDS database is covered in [Step 1: Create an RDS DB Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateDBInstance.html). It is also briefly mentioned in this video: [Jets Tutorial Deploy to AWS Lambda Part 2: AWS Lambda Ruby](20180908-jets-tutorial-deploy-to-aws-lambda-part-2.md).

Also, remember to migrate your remote database:

```sh
JETS_ENV_REMOTE=1 jets db:create db:migrate
```

Now weâ€™re ready to deploy:

```sh
jets deploy
#
# ...
# https://mf3z5ou0b1.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/
```

Go to the url provided at the end of the deploy. 

![You should be able to upload the same way you did locally and should see a similar posts show page](https://blog.boltops.com/img/posts/2018/12/upload-posts-show-image-lambda.png)
