In this post and video, weâ€™ll cover how to deploy a Rails application to AWS Lambda Serverless in a few minutes. With Jets Afterburner, you donâ€™t have to make any changes to your Rails application to get it on AWS Lambda. ðŸŽ‰

---

## Commands

```sh
gem install jets # outside of Gemfile
git clone https://github.com/tongueroo/demo-rails
cd demo-rails
mkdir -p .jets/app
vim .jets/app/.env # add your env variables
jets deploy
#
# => Rails app detected: Enabling Jets Afterburner to deploy to AWS Lambda.
# ...
# Deploying CloudFormation stack with jets app!
# 05:05:11PM UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS AWS::CloudFormation::Stack demo-rails-dev User Initiated
# ...
# 05:06:48PM UPDATE_COMPLETE AWS::CloudFormation::Stack demo-rails-dev
# Stack success status: UPDATE_COMPLETE
# Time took for stack deployment: 1m 36s.
# Prewarming application.
# API Gateway Endpoint: https://jp65zxlwf8.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/
#
```

Thatâ€™s it! We have successfully deployed our Rails application to AWS Lambda. Hereâ€™s the [Live Demo](https://afterburner.demo.rubyonjets.com/) from the tutorial. The full source code of the Rails project is on Github: [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`tongueroo/demo-rails`](https://github.com/tongueroo/demo-rails). More info is available at: [Jets Rails Support: Afterburner Mode](http://rubyonjets.com/docs/rails-support/).

## Extra Environments

An interesting benefit of running applications on AWS Lambda is that you only get charged for actual requests. So [extra environments](20180913-jets-tutorial-extra-environments-part-7.md) are likely in the [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). You could do this:

```
JETS_ENV_EXTRA=2 jets deploy
JETS_ENV_EXTRA=3 jets deploy
...
JETS_ENV_EXTRA=8 jets deploy
```

You essentially get unlimited free environments, each of them taking a few minutes to provision.

- [Image Upload with CarrierWave](https://upload.demo.rubyonjets.com/)
- [Mega Mode: Jets and Rails Combined](https://mega.demo.rubyonjets.com/)

## Considerations

Afterburner mode is pretty awesome but is not a panacea for all Rails applications. Each and every Rails application is different and likely makes assumptions that itâ€™s running on a traditional server not serverless. For example, the app might upload files or images to the filesystem. This doesnâ€™t work on AWS Lambda because the app doesnâ€™t have access to a persistent filesystem. The application would have to be reworked to use a distributed store like S3 instead.

Ruby serverless applications might also use native binary gems. Jets uses [Lambda Gems](https://www.lambdagems.com/) to make for a seamless and much easier deploy process. [Lambda Gems](https://blog.boltops.com/2019/01/01/introducing-lamdagems-hassle-free-serverless-ruby-build-and-deploy) is currently in beta, and early signups will receive a special offer for their support.
