<VidStack src="youtube/RwRMTAjWVtM" />

This video tutorial demos the jets delete command. Since all the infrastructure is codified, deleting a Jets application is a straightforward process. Whatâ€™s more interesting is that it is also easy to recreate the entire environment.

```sh
jets delete
```

For more info on the [`jets delete`](http://rubyonjets.com/reference/jets-delete/) command, refer to its CLI reference.

## Whatâ€™s Deleted

- S3 Bucket that was created and managed by Jets
- All the CloudFormation stacks that that creates most of the Jets resources: Lambda Functions, API Gateway, CloudWatch Event Rules, etc.
- CloudWatch Log Groups: to clean up the listing page
