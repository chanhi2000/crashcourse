When it comes to command line text processing, the three major pillars are `grep` for filtering, `sed` for substitution and `awk` for field processing. These tools have overlapping features too, for example, all three of them have extensive filtering capabilities.

Unlike `grep` and `sed`, `awk` is a programming language. However, this book intends to showcase `awk` one-liners that can be composed from the command line instead of focusing on larger scripts.

This book heavily leans on examples to present features one by one. Regular expressions will also be discussed in detail.

It is recommended that you manually type each example. Make an effort to understand the sample input as well as the solution presented and check if the output changes (or not!) when you alter some part of the input and the command. As an analogy, consider learning to drive a car — no matter how much you read about them or listen to explanations, you'd need practical experience to become proficient.

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with command line usage in a Unix-like environment. You should also be comfortable with concepts like file redirection and command pipelines. Knowing the basics of the `grep` and `sed` commands will be handy in understanding the filtering and substitution features of awk.

As `awk` is a programming language, you are also expected to be familiar with concepts like variables, printing, functions, control structures, arrays and so on.

If you are new to the world of the command line, check out my [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/> Computing from the Command Line](https://github.com/learnbyexample/cli-computing) ebook and curated resources on [Linux CLI and Shell scripting](https://learnbyexample.github.io/curated_resources/linux_cli_scripting.html) before starting this book.

## Conventions

- The examples presented here have been tested with __GNU awk__ version __5.2.2__ and includes features not available in earlier versions.
- Code snippets are copy pasted from the `GNU bash` shell and modified for presentation purposes. Some commands are preceded by comments to provide context and explanations. Blank lines to improve readability, only real time shown for speed comparisons, output skipped for commands like `wget` and so on.
- Unless otherwise noted, all examples and explanations are meant for __ASCII input__.
- `awk` would mean `GNU awk`, `sed` would mean `GNU sed`, `grep` would mean `GNU grep` and so on unless otherwise specified.
External links are provided throughout the book for you to explore certain topics in more depth.
The [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/> learn_gnuawk repo](https://github.com/learnbyexample/learn_gnuawk) has all the code snippets and files used in examples, exercises and other details related to the book. If you are not familiar with the `git` command, click the __Code__ button on the webpage to get the files.
