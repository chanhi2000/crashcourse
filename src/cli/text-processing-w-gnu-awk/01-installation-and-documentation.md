The command name `awk` is derived from its developers — Alfred V. Aho, Peter J. Weinberger, and Brian W. Kernighan. Over the years, it has been adapted and modified by various other developers. [See gawk manual: History](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#History) for more details.

This chapter will show how to install or upgrade awk followed by details related to documentation.

## Installation

If you are on a Unix-like system, you will most likely have some version of `awk` already installed. This book is primarily about `GNU awk`. As there are syntax and feature differences between various implementations, make sure to use `GNU awk` to follow along the examples presented in this book.

`GNU awk` is part of the [text creation and manipulation](https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html) commands and usually comes by default on GNU/Linux distributions. To install a particular version, visit [gnu: gawk software](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/). See also [release notes](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/cgi-bin/namazu.cgi?query=gawk+released&submit=Search%21&idxname=info-gnu&max=20&result=normal&sort=date%3Alate) for an overview of changes between versions.

```sh
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gawk/gawk-5.2.2.tar.xz
tar -Jxf gawk-5.2.2.tar.xz
cd gawk-5.2.2/
# see https://askubuntu.com/q/237576 if you get compiler not found error
./configure
make
sudo make install

awk --version | head -n1
# GNU Awk 5.2.2, API 3.2, PMA Avon 8-g1
```

If you are not using a Linux distribution, you may be able to access `GNU awk` using an option below:

- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) — provides a Bash emulation used to run Git from the command line
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) — compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows
- [brew](https://brew.sh/) — Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)

::: info 

See also [gawk manual: Installation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Installation.html) for advanced options and instructions to install awk on other platforms.

## Documentation

It is always good to know where to find documentation. From the command line, you can use `man awk` for a short manual and `info awk` for the full documentation. I prefer using the [online gnu awk manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/), which feels much easier to use and navigate.

Here's a snippet from `man awk`:

```sh
man awk
# GAWK(1)                        Utility Commands                        GAWK(1)  
#   
# NAME
#        gawk - pattern scanning and processing language
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        gawk [ POSIX or GNU style options ] -f program-file [ -- ] file ...
#        gawk [ POSIX or GNU style options ] [ -- ] program-text file ...
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        Gawk  is  the  GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming lan‐
#        guage.  It conforms to the definition of  the  language  in  the  POSIX
#        1003.1  Standard.   This version in turn is based on the description in
#        The AWK Programming Language, by Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger.   Gawk
#        provides  the additional features found in the current version of Brian
#        Kernighan's awk and numerous GNU-specific extensions.
```

## Options overview

For a quick overview of all the available options, use `awk --help` from the command line.

```sh
awk --help
