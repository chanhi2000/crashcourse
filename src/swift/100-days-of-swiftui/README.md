## How it works

Welcome to the 100 Days of SwiftUI! This is a free collection of videos, tutorials, tests, and more, all drawn from around my work here on Hacking with Swift, and all designed to help you learn SwiftUI effectively.

It’s aimed squarely at beginners who want to learn to build real iOS apps, but struggle to find a good, free course that can help them achieve their goals. If that’s you, welcome – I hope you’re ready to show the iOS world what you’re made of!

If you’re looking for [my original 100 Days of Swift, click here][100-days-of-swift] – 100 Days of SwiftUI and 100 Days of Swift both teach you to build apps with Swift, but this one focuses on SwiftUI whereas the other teaches UIKit, SpriteKit, and more. If you’re not sure which to choose, stay here with SwiftUI.

__PS: If you have questions, [ask me][ask-me] – I’m here to help!__

### Rules

If you want to make a success of this course, there are only two rules:

1. Every day you spend one hour reading or watching SwiftUI tutorials, or writing SwiftUI code.
2. Every day you post about your progress to the social media site of your choosing. Tell people!

I’ll be providing all the material you need to follow along, so all you need to do is show up ready to learn. I’ve even provided a “Tweet” button at the end of every day, which composes a tweet for you saying you completed the day, and includes the hashtag to help others find you, a celebratory graphic, and a link for others to find out more – use it!

I’ve tried to make sure it takes less than one hour to complete each day, but there is a little natural variation. For example, day 4 is a little shorter because it has less ground to cover, and day 13 is a little longer because it has a few complex topics inside.

### Tips

I’ve met so many who have tried and failed to learn Swift, often multiple times, and if you’re here there’s a good chance you’ve already had a few false starts already.

Not this time. This time you’re going to learn it for real, and in just 100 days you’ll have built many full apps that you can be proud of.

You’ve already read the two rules of these 100 days, but to maximize your chance of rocking this course I have a few tips:

1. __It’s a marathon, not a sprint.__ Don’t charge ahead thinking you’re “learning faster”, because there’s a high chance you’ll get lost. Take your time!
2. __Don’t fall prey to shiny object syndrome.__ The lure of spending $100 on another course is high, I know, but you don’t learn anything by buying books. Your best chance of success is sticking with the 100 days shown here and really make it work, so if you’re already thinking “I can do this course at the same time as Other SwiftUI Course” you’re just setting yourself up to fail.
3. __Don’t lone wolf it.__ You aren’t learning by yourself – I’m here to help as are many others. If you have questions, [tweet me at @twostraws][ask-me] and I’ll do my best to help!
4. __Use the consolidation days.__ These are spaced throughout the 100 days to give you time to review what you’ve learned and make it really sink in. Use them to go back over days you weren’t sure about, complete any homework you missed, or just do some free coding.
5. I have [a glossary of common Swift terms][glossary] that you should bookmark for easy reference.
6. If you get stuck with some SwiftUI code, you should refer to my free online book [SwiftUI by Example][swiftui-by-example] – it has over 600 pages of sample code and solutions for SwiftUI.
7. [Download my Unwrap app from the App Store.](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1440611372) It works on iPhone and iPad, contains alternative tutorials for the initial part of this course, and is free with no in-app purchases.

## The Course

### Preparation

This introductory day prepares you for the course, explains core concepts, and helps you avoid the most common mistakes faced by other learners.

- [Day 0][day-0] – tips and advice before you start.
 

### ✅Days 1-14: Introduction to Swift

The first 14 days provide a gentle warm up for your SwiftUI learning as we cover the fundamentals of the Swift programming language. You’ll work through a selection of tutorials every day, and there is some optional extra reading afterwards if you’d like to dig deeper.

Regardless of whether or not you go over the optional extra reading, you’ll find lots of short short tests – I recommend you take them to really solidify what you’ve learned.

- [Day 1][day-1] – variables, constants, strings, and numbers
- [Day 2][day-2] – Booleans, string interpolation, and checkpoint 1
- [Day 3][day-3] – Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums
- [Day 4][day-4] – type annotations and checkpoint 2
- [Day 5][day-5] – if, switch, and the ternary operator
- [Day 6][day-6] – loops, summary, and checkpoint 3
- [Day 7][day-7] – functions, parameters, and return values
- [Day 8][day-8] – default values, throwing functions, and checkpoint 4
- [Day 9][day-9] – closures, passing functions into functions, and checkpoint 5
- [Day 10][day-10] – structs, computed properties, and property observers
- [Day 11][day-11] – access control, static properties and methods, and checkpoint 6
- [Day 12][day-12] – classes, inheritance, and checkpoint 7
