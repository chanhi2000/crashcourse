## Swift review

Congratulations! You made it through all the fundamentals of the Swift programming language. Each day was purposefully very short to give you a solid introduction to the topic, but today is different because we’re going to be reviewing almost everything you learned so far.

__I know what you’re thinking.__ You’re thinking “why bother? I already learned this stuff – why go over it again?”

Well, there are several reasons:

- Repetition helps us learn things more thoroughly. These fundamentals are really important in all the Swift you’ll write, so it’s worth doubling down to make sure you understand them fully.
- Some concepts only make complete sense when you’ve understood other concepts. Circling back like this will help link together the core Swift concepts in your head.
- You might have missed something. Let’s face it, you’ve just gone through a ton of videos about the most important parts of Swift – are you absolutely sure you remembered all of it?
- You’ll see how far you’ve come. When you read about arrays and loops – things you might have found challenging previously – hopefully you’ll find them easier now, and feel good that you’re making progress.

And if you _do_ find today easy, that’s okay – immediately afterwards we’ll be starting the SwiftUI projects at which point the difficulty level ramps up. Enjoy the quiet while it lasts!

__Today you have just one tutorial to follow, although it’s pretty darn packed.__ This tutorial recaps almost every topic we’ve covered so far using precise code samples from the various days, and is available either as an hour-long video or one long text article.

- Here’s the tutorial you need to follow today: [Learn essential Swift in one hour](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/242/learn-essential-swift-in-one-hour).

::: note Optional

once you’ve finished reviewing that  article, you can go back to the [review page](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review) and go over any tests related to the topics above that you want – it’s your choice/

:::

### Bonus: find the Swifty words!

I’ve made a word search to help you test your knowledge of the most useful terms for Swift developers. You can [download it as a PDF here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/files/100/15-wordsearch.pdf), and if you need help you can try looking through my [Swift glossary](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/glossary).

__There are dozens to find, and words can go in all directions – good luck!__
