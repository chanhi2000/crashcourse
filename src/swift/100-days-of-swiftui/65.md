## Project 13, part 4

Today we‚Äôre going to be putting into practice some of the techniques you just learned, including how to create custom bindings, how to bring user-selected images into your app, and how to apply Core Filter effects to an image.

One thing I hope you notice is how I frequently lead you back to a topic we looked at previously. This isn‚Äôt an accident: as the self-help author Napoleon Hill wrote, ‚Äúany idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought‚Äù ‚Äì this repetition is one of several approaches I use to help you internalize how all this code fits together.

And even if you don‚Äôt fully get these concepts today, that‚Äôs okay ‚Äì we‚Äôll be covering them again the future.

__Today you have three topics to work through, in which you‚Äôll put into practice using `PhotosPicker`, filtering images using Core Image, and more.__

### Building our basic UI

::: details Building our basic UI

<YouTube id="VTZQ4SQmVmg" />

The first step in our project is to build the basic user interface, which for this app will be:

1. A `NavigationStack` so we can show our app‚Äôs name at the top.
2. A box prompting users to select a photo, over which we‚Äôll place their imported picture.
3. An ‚ÄúIntensity‚Äù slider that will affect how strongly we apply our Core Image filters, stored as a value from 0.0 to 1.0.
4. A sharing button to export the processed image from the app.
We won't put all those bits in place to begin with; just enough so you can see how things fit together.

Initially the user won‚Äôt have selected an image, so we‚Äôll represent that using an `@State` optional image property.

First add these two properties to `ContentView`:

```swift
@State private var processedImage: Image?
@State private var filterIntensity = 0.5
```

Now modify the contents of its `body` property to this:

```swift
NavigationStack {
    VStack {
        Spacer()

        // image area

        Spacer()

        HStack {
            Text("Intensity")
            Slider(value: $filterIntensity)
        }
        .padding(.vertical)

        HStack {
            Button("Change Filter") {
                // change filter
            }

            Spacer()

            // share the picture
        }
    }
    .padding([.horizontal, .bottom])
    .navigationTitle("Instafilter")
}
```

That uses two spacers so that we always get space above and below the image area, which also ensures the filter controls stay fixed to the bottom of the screen.

In terms of what should go in place of the `// image area` comment, it will be one of two things: if we have an image already selected then we should show it, otherwise we'll display a simple `ContentUnavailableView` so users know that space isn't just accidentally blank:

```swift
if let processedImage {
    processedImage
        .resizable()
        .scaledToFit()
} else {
    ContentUnavailableView("No Picture", systemImage: "photo.badge.plus", description: Text("Tap to import a photo"))
}
```

I love being able to place optional views right inside a SwiftUI layout, and I think it works particularly well with `ContentUnavailableView` because only one is visible at a time. Yes, tapping the view won't do anything yet, but we'll tackle that shortly.

Now, as our code was fairly easy here, I want to just briefly explore what it looks like to clean up our `body` property a little ‚Äì we have lots of layout code in there, but there's also a button action inside there too.

Yes, the Change Filter button isn't going to have a lot of complex functionality inside it, but this is good practice in splitting off button actions.

Right now that just means adding an empty method to `ContentView`, like this:

```swift
func changeFilter() {
}
```

Then calling it from the Change Filter button, like this:

```swift
Button("Change Filter", action: changeFilter)
```

When you‚Äôre learning it‚Äôs very common to write button actions and similar directly inside your views, but once you get onto real projects it‚Äôs a good idea to spend extra time keeping your code cleaned up ‚Äì it makes your life easier in the long term, trust me!

I‚Äôll be adding more little cleanup tips like this going forward, so as you start to approach the end of the course you feel increasingly confident that your code is in good shape.

### Importing an image into SwiftUI using `PhotosPicker`

::: details Importing an image into SwiftUI using PhotosPicker

[üìélink](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/importing-an-image-into-swiftui-using-photospicker)

<YouTube id="kwNbOIfJzRM" />

In order to bring this project to life, we need to let the user select a photo from their library, then display it in `ContentView`. This takes a little thinking, mostly because of the roundabout way Core Image works compared to SwiftUI.

First we need to add an import for PhotosUI to the top of `ContentView`, then give it an extra `@State` property to track whatever picture the user selected:

```swift
@State private var selectedItem: PhotosPickerItem?
```

Second, we need to place a `PhotosPicker` view wherever we want to trigger an image selection. In this app, we can actually place one around the whole `if let processedImage` check ‚Äì we can use the selected image or the `ContentUnavailableView` as the label for our `PhotosPicker`.

Here's how that looks:

```swift
PhotosPicker(selection: $selectedItem) {
    if let processedImage {
        processedImage
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
    } else {
        ContentUnavailableView("No Picture", systemImage: "photo.badge.plus", description: Text("Import a photo to get started"))
    }
}
```

Tip: That adds blue coloring to the `ContentUnavailableView` to signal that's interactive, but you can disable that by adding `.buttonStyle(.plain)` to the `PhotosPicker` if you prefer.

Third, we need a method that will be called when the an image has been selected.

Previously I showed you how how we can load data from a `PhotosPicker` selection, and separately I also showed you how to feed a `UIImage` into Core Image for filtering. Here we need to kind of bolt those two things together: we can't load a simple SwiftUI image because they can't be fed into Core Image, so instead we load a pure `Data` object and convert that to a `UIImage`.

Add this method to `ContentView` now:

```swift
func loadImage() {
    Task {
        guard let imageData = try await selectedItem?.loadTransferable(type: Data.self) else { return }
        guard let inputImage = UIImage(data: imageData) else { return }

        // more code to come
    }
}
```

We can then call that whenever our `selectedItem` property changes, by attaching an `onChange()` modifier somewhere in `ContentView` ‚Äì it really doesn‚Äôt matter where, but attaching it to the `PhotosPicker` would seem sensible.

```swift
.onChange(of: selectedItem, loadImage)
```

Go ahead and run the app again ‚Äì although it won't actually do much with your selection, you can at least bring up the photo selection UI and browse through the options.

### Basic image filtering using Core Image

::: details Basic image filtering using Core Image

[üìélink](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/basic-image-filtering-using-core-image)

<YouTube id="qr7Iaq7_fko" />

Now that our project has an image the user selected, the next step is to let the user apply varying Core Image filters to it. To start with we‚Äôre just going to work with a single filter, but shortly we‚Äôll extend that using a confirmation dialog.

If we want to use Core Image in our apps, we first need to add two imports to the top of <FontIcon icon="fas fa-dove"/>`ContentView.swift`:

```swift
import CoreImage
import CoreImage.CIFilterBuiltins
```

Next we need both a context and a filter. A Core Image context is an object that‚Äôs responsible for rendering a `CIImage` to a `CGImage`, or in more practical terms an object for converting the recipe for an image into an actual series of pixels we can work with.

Contexts are expensive to create, so if you intend to render many images it‚Äôs a good idea to create a context once and keep it alive. As for the filter, we‚Äôll be using `CIFilter.sepiaTone()` as our default but because we‚Äôll make it flexible later we‚Äôll make the filter use `@State` so it can be changed.

So, add these two properties to `ContentView`:

```swift
@State private var currentFilter = CIFilter.sepiaTone()
let context = CIContext()
```

With those two in place we can now write a method that will process whatever image was imported ‚Äì that means it will set our sepia filter‚Äôs intensity based on the value in `filterIntensity`, read the output image back from the filter, ask our `CIContext` to render it, then place the result into our `processedImage` property so it‚Äôs visible on-screen.

```swift
func applyProcessing() {
    currentFilter.intensity = Float(filterIntensity)

    guard let outputImage = currentFilter.outputImage else { return }
    guard let cgImage = context.createCGImage(outputImage, from: outputImage.extent) else { return }

    let uiImage = UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)
    processedImage = Image(uiImage: uiImage)
}
```

Tip: Sadly the Core Image behind the sepia tone filter wants `Float` rather than `Double` for its values. This makes Core Image feel even older, I know, but don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì we‚Äôll make it go away soon!

The next job is to change the way `loadImage()` works. Right now it ends with a `// more code to come` comment, but really it should send whatever image was chosen into the sepia tone filter, then call `applyProcessing()` to make the magic happen.

Core Image filters have a dedicated `inputImage` property that lets us send in a `CIImage` for the filter to work with, but often this is thoroughly broken and will cause your app to crash ‚Äì it‚Äôs much safer to use the filter‚Äôs `setValue()` method with the key `kCIInputImageKey`.

So, replace the `// more code to come` comment with this:

```swift
let beginImage = CIImage(image: inputImage)
currentFilter.setValue(beginImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)
applyProcessing()
```

If you run the code now you‚Äôll see our basic app flow works great: we can select an image, then see it with a sepia effect applied. But that intensity slider we added doesn‚Äôt do anything, even though it‚Äôs bound to the same `filterIntensity` value that our filter is reading from.

What‚Äôs happening here ought not to be too surprising: even though the slider is changing the value of `filterIntensity`, changing that property won‚Äôt automatically trigger our `applyProcessing()` method again. Instead, we need to do that by hand by telling SwiftUI to watch `filterIntensity` with `onChange()`.

Again, these `onChange()` modifiers can go anywhere in our SwiftUI view hierarchy, but as the slider changes the value directly I'll attach it there:

```swift
Slider(value: $filterIntensity)
    .onChange(of: filterIntensity, applyProcessing)
```

__Tip__: If multiple views adjust the same value, or if it‚Äôs not quite so specific what is changing the value, then I‚Äôd add the modifier at the end of the view.

You can go ahead and run the app now, but be warned: even though Core Image is extremely fast on all iPhones, it‚Äôs often extremely _slow_ in the simulator. That means you can try it out to make sure everything works, but don‚Äôt be surprised if your code runs at a glacial pace.
