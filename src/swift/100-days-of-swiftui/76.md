## Project 15, part 3

Now that you‚Äôve seen how easy it is to fix up our projects, it‚Äôs time for you to continue that job with some challenges and a review of what you‚Äôve learned. I think you won‚Äôt find it hard at all, and perhaps even will continue to be surprised at how easy SwiftUI makes accessibility.

Steve Ballmer (yes, _that_ Steve Ballmer) once said ‚Äúaccessible design is good design ‚Äì it benefits people who don‚Äôt have disabilities as well as people who do.‚Äù And he‚Äôs right: taking the time to make sure your app works for everyone will provide long-lasting benefits for all your users.

__Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 15, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.__

### Accessibility: Wrap up

::: details Accessibility: Wrap up

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "100 Days of SwiftUI ‚Äì Day 76 - Accessibility: Wrap up",
  "desc": "Accessibility: Wrap up",
  "link": "https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/accessibility-wrap-up",
  "logo": "https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon-96x96.png",
  "background": "rgb(213,52,58,0.2)"
}
```

Accessibility isn‚Äôt something that‚Äôs ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù ‚Äì it should be regarded as a fundamental part of your application design, and considered from the very beginning onwards. SwiftUI didn‚Äôt get its excellent accessibility support because Apple thought about it at the last minute, but instead because it got baked in from the start ‚Äì every part of SwiftUI was crafted with accessibility in mind, and we‚Äôd be doing a great disservice to our users if we didn‚Äôt match that same standard.

What‚Äôs more, I hope you can agree that adding extra accessibility is surprisingly easy ‚Äì some special values here, a little grouping there, and some bonus traits are all simple things that take only minutes to add, but are the difference between ‚Äúopaque‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy to use‚Äù for millions of people around the world.

#### Review what you learned

Anyone can sit through a tutorial, but it takes actual work to remember what was taught. It‚Äôs my job to make sure you take as much from these tutorials as possible, so I‚Äôve prepared a short review to help you check your learning.

#### Challenge

One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully understand what‚Äôs going on.

1. The check out view in Cupcake Corner uses an image and loading spinner that don‚Äôt add anything to the UI, so find a way to make the screenreader not read them out.
2. Fix the list rows in iExpense so they read out the name and value in one single VoiceOver label, and their type in a hint.
3. Do a full accessibility review of Moonshot ‚Äì what changes do you need to make so that it‚Äôs fully accessible?
