## What you’ll learn

- How to use [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), Apple’s advanced tool for developing apps
- The basics of [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), Apple’s modern programming language, which is designed to be easy to learn and fun to use
- A foundation in [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), which helps you build great-looking apps with the power of Swift

Each chapter introduces new concepts in Swift and SwiftUI through the experience of building a small project in Xcode. Start with the tutorial, where you’ll follow step-by-step instructions to create prototypes, app screens, and fully functioning apps. After the tutorial, read a wrap-up article to review what you learned and continue practicing your new skills.

If you are an educator, download the [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-download"/>Educator Guide](https://apple.co/dis-devpubs-educatorguide) for an overview of the skills and topics introduced in each chapter.

## What you’ll need

- Curiosity and imagination
- A Mac running macOS Sonoma or Ventura
- Xcode

Install [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-apple"/>Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) from the Mac App Store. Xcode is a large app, so you’ll need to give your computer time to install it.

__Note__: You don’t need an iOS device. Xcode includes tools that show you how your app will look and work, right on your Mac.

## A few words of advice

- The only way to learn to develop apps is to make them. It’s an art you practice, just like learning to paint or play an instrument.
- Type the code in your projects instead of copying and pasting from the tutorials. You’ll build your skills and confidence more quickly.
- Bring your own ideas. The project in each chapter can be a great starting point to build something you care about.
