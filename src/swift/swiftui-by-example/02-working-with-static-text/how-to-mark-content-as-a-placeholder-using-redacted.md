> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI lets us mark text as a placeholder in our view, meaning that it gets rendered but masked out with gray to show it isn’t final content. This is provided through the `redacted(reason:)` modifier, along with an `unredacted()` modifier you can use to override redaction as needed.

Here’s how it looks in code:

```swift
Text("This is placeholder text")
    .font(.title)
    .redacted(reason: .placeholder)
```

You can redact several things in your view at once, just by using `redacted(reason:)` on a container, like this:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("This is placeholder text")
    Text("And so is this")
}
.font(.title)    
.redacted(reason: .placeholder)
```

Two gray rectangles representing two lines of redacted text.

Apple has said that redaction is an additive process, meaning that if you add redaction reasons to both a parent and a child then they will combine. Right now there’s only `.placeholder`, but perhaps we’ll see pixellation or similar in the future?

You can also query any redaction reasons passed in from the environment like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.redactionReasons) var redactionReasons
    let bio = "The rain in Spain falls mainly on the Spaniards"

    var body: some View {
        if redactionReasons == .placeholder {
            Text("Loading…")
        } else {
            Text(bio)
                .redacted(reason: redactionReasons)
        }
    }
}
```

::: tip

Redaction also works on images using the same code as shown above.
