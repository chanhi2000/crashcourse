> Updated for Xcode 15

If you’ve used UIKit before, many of the classes you know and love map pretty much directly to their SwiftUI equivalents just by dropping the `UI` prefix. That doesn’t mean they are the same thing underneath, just that they have the same or similar functionality.

Here’s a list to get you started, with UIKit class names followed by SwiftUI names:

- `UITableView`: `List`
- `UICollectionView`: `LazyVGrid` and `LazyHGrid`
- `UIScrollView`: `ScrollView`
- `UILabel`: `Text`
- `UITextField`: `TextField`
- `UITextField` with `isSecureTextEntry` set to true: `SecureField`
- `UITextView`: `TextEditor` (plain strings only)
- `UISwitch`: `Toggle`
- `UISlider`: `Slider`
- `UIButton`: `Button`
- `UINavigationController`: `NavigationStack` or `NavigationSplitView`
- `UIAlertController` with style `.alert`: `.alert()`
- `UIAlertController` with style `.actionSheet`: `.confirmationDialog()`
- `UIStackView` with horizontal axis: `HStack`
- `UIStackView` with vertical axis: `VStack`
- `UIImageView`: `Image`
- `UISegmentedControl`: `Picker`
- `UIStepper`: `Stepper`
- `UIDatePicker`: `DatePicker`
- `UIProgressView`: `ProgressView` with a value
- `UIActivityIndicatorView`: `ProgressView` without a value
- `MKMapView`: `Map`
- `NSAttributedString`: `AttributedString`.

There are many other components that are exclusive to SwiftUI, such as a stack view that lets us build things by depth rather than horizontally or vertically.
