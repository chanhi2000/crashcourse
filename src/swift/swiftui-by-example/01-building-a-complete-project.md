> Updated for Xcode 15

<VidStack id="M6v6y-KyJs0" />

This is a complete, free SwiftUI tutorial designed to take you through lots of its functionality in a single project. It‚Äôs aimed at people who have existing programming experience with UIKit, but most things are explained in detail so newcomers ought to be able to follow along.

__Important__: This was written for iOS 16.1, so you‚Äôll need at least Xcode 14.1 to follow along. This is available as a free download from the Mac App Store if you don‚Äôt already have it.

The project we‚Äôll be making is called iDine, and is a restaurant app that lists items in a menu and helps folks place orders. I‚Äôve designed the project specifically so that it covers as many different techniques as possible to give you a good grounding in how things work in SwiftUI. Of course, we‚Äôre also building a real project at the same time ‚Äì it‚Äôs going to be busy!

::: tip Note

If you‚Äôd like to see my completed version of this project, you can find it here on GitHub: [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`twostraws/iDine`](https://github.com/twostraws/iDine).

:::

To get started, please create a new iOS project in Xcode called ‚ÄúiDine‚Äù, choosing the App template. You should also select SwiftUI for the Interface, but please leave all the checkboxes unchecked.

Xcode‚Äôs project creation window, configured to create a SwiftUI app.

There are quite a few assets provided for this project that you need to copy in before you start. These are all in the assets for this project, which you can download [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-select"/>here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/samples/idine.zip).

Please copy them into your project like this:

- Drag Helper.swift into your project navigator. This contains a helper extension that makes it easier to decode `Codable` data from a bundle. This is not related to SwiftUI, so we won‚Äôt be covering it here.
- You should also drag Order.swift and Menu.swift into the project navigator. These are custom types that store the data we‚Äôre using in the app.
- And drag menu.json into your project navigator too ‚Äì this describes all the menu items our restaurant offers, and will be decoded into instances of `MenuSection` and `MenuItem`.
- Drag the contents of the Images directory into your asset catalog, so we have all the pictures we need.

![Dragging our artwork into Xcode‚Äôs asset catalog.](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/2-2~dark.png)

OK, that‚Äôs it ‚Äì we‚Äôre ready to go!

__Tip__: At the end of each chapter I‚Äôve added a ‚ÄúFurther reading‚Äù section that suggests links to other chapters in this book. You don‚Äôt need to read them in order to follow along; they are there to provide extra information and detail if you want to understand the bigger picture more thoroughly.

## Building a menu using List

::: details Building a menu using List

```component VPCard

  "background": "rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"
}
```

<VidStack src="youtube/62agNUDHh3U" />

We‚Äôre going to start simple, and work our way up. Along the way you‚Äôll start to see some of the things that SwiftUI makes easy, and some of the things that are a bit harder.

In <FontIcon icon="fas fa-dove"/>`ContentView.swift` is a basic struct representing the only screen in our app: `ContentView`. It looks like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: "globe")
                .imageScale(.large)
                .foregroundStyle(.accentColor)
            Text("Hello, world!")
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

That isn‚Äôt much code, but it already tells us a lot:

1. Views are structs in SwiftUI.
2. All views must conform to the `View` protocol.
3. That protocol requires a computed property called `body` that contains the actual layout for the view.
4. It returns `some View`, which is a Swift feature called _opaque return types_ ‚Äì it means ‚Äúone specific sort of view, but we don‚Äôt really care which one.‚Äù
5. Inside our content view is a small amount of UI: an image showing a globe icon and some text saying ‚ÄúHello, world‚Äù, both wrapped up in a `VStack` to make them vertically aligned. We‚Äôll be looking at these views in more detail as we progress.
6. There‚Äôs are some method calls in place: `.imageScale()`, `.foregroundStyle()`, and `padding()`. In SwiftUI we call these _modifiers_ because they modify the way the text view looks or acts.

You should also see a preview pane on the right of Xcode. This updates as you type, which makes it a great way to see your changes as you work. If you don‚Äôt see the preview pane on the right, go to the Editor menu and choose Canvas.

In the event that Xcode‚Äôs preview area stops ‚Äì which will happen quite often ‚Äì you can press Opt-Cmd-P to make it resume showing your layouts.

__This is really important so I‚Äôm repeating it: pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Opt</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> will make your SwiftUI preview update.__

![Xcode showing code on one side and the SwiftUI preview area on the other side.](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/2-3~dark.png)

In our app this screen will show us a list of items from a menu, so we‚Äôre going to use a `List` view instead of Xcode‚Äôs default template code.

So, replace the current text view with this:

```swift
List {
    Text("Hello World")
    Text("Hello World")
    Text("Hello World")
}
```

When the preview updates you‚Äôll now see the equivalent of UIKit‚Äôs `UITableView` with three pieces of text, all saying ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù. This is a _static_ list view ‚Äì we‚Äôre sending in three pieces of fixed data, so it interprets them as three rows in the table.

In our app the menu will contain a list of items that can be ordered, and tapping one of them will show a new screen with details about that order item. This works just like in UIKit: we wrap our table in a navigation control.

In SwiftUI this navigation control is a `NavigationStack`, which combines the display styling of `UINavigationBar` and the view controller stack behavior of `UINavigationController`. To bring one in, just add `NavigationStack` around your list, like this:

```swift
NavigationStack {
    List {
        Text("Hello World")
        Text("Hello World")
        Text("Hello World")
    }
}
```

When the preview updates you‚Äôll see things look the same, but that‚Äôs only because we haven‚Äôt given it a title yet.

Earlier I mentioned the `padding()` modifier briefly, saying modifiers got that name because they modify the way views look or act. SwiftUI has many modifiers ‚Äì hundreds, easily ‚Äì and each one lets you customize the behavior of a view in one very specific way.

Yes, modifiers _look_ like regular Swift methods, but they are more complex because they actually _change_ what they apply to. In simple terms, if you have some text and apply the `padding()` modifier, you don‚Äôt just get some text back that happens to have some space around it ‚Äì you actually get a different _type_ back.

In this case, we want to apply a `navigationTitle()` modifier to our list view, which accepts some sort of text to show in the navigation bar. So, we‚Äôd write this:

```swift
NavigationStack {
    List {
        Text("Hello World")
        Text("Hello World")
        Text("Hello World")
    }
    .navigationTitle("Menu")
}
```

Yes, the modifier is attached to the list rather than the navigation stack ‚Äì think of how we‚Äôd set the title of a `UIViewController` rather than try to set the title of a `UINavigationController`.

![Xcode showing code with three list items, and the SwiftUI preview showing that rendered in a virtual device.](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/2-4~dark.png)

If you try running the app now you‚Äôll see that it all works exactly as we would expect ‚Äì the table scrolls around, the navigation bar shrinks as you scroll, and so on. One of the great things that SwiftUI does is give us modern system behavior by default, so we get large navigation bar titles as standard.

Static text works fine when you have fixed table cells, but in our case we have lots of menu items to load across a number of sections ‚Äì breakfast, mains, dessert, and drinks. What we _really_ want to do is load our menu data from JSON, then use _that_ for our list items, and that‚Äôs actually not too hard to accomplish.

First we need to load our data. The Helper.swift file you already imported contains code for loading `Codable` JSON from the app bundle, which is perfect for loading our <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-json"/>`menu.json` file. So, add this property to the `ContentView` struct now:

```swift
let menu = Bundle.main.decode([MenuSection].self, from: "menu.json")
```

Next we need to make our list go over the sections in our menu. This is done by using a `ForEach` block, which loops over items in an array and repeats whatever is inside:

```swift
List {
    ForEach(menu) {
        Text("Hello World")
        Text("Hello World")
        Text("Hello World")
    }
}
```

The opening braces after `List` and `ForEach` actually signify the start of a closure, and in the case of `ForEach` SwiftUI will pass into the closure each section from the array so that we can configure it.

So, we need to accept that section by modifying the code to this:

```swift
ForEach(menu) { section in
```

That _almost_ works, but there‚Äôs one last thing we need to do. SwiftUI needs to know how to identify every cell in our table ‚Äì it needs to know exactly which is which, so it can add and remove things for us if we ask. When we had a static list this wasn‚Äôt a problem because it could see there were three, but now we have a dynamic list we need to tell it something about each section that makes it unique.

If you open Menu.swift you‚Äôll see structs that define `MenuSection` and `MenuItem`, and both of them have `id` properties that contain a `UUID` ‚Äì a universally unique identifier. This is perfect for our use, because every menu item in every section has a unique identifier so SwiftUI can know which is which.

We can tell SwiftUI to use those identifiers by making the two types conform to `Identifiable`. This protocol has only one requirement, which is that conforming types must have a property called `id` that can identify them uniquely. We already have that, so just adding `Identifiable` to those two types is enough:

```swift
struct MenuSection: Codable, Identifiable {
```

And:

```swift
struct MenuItem: Codable, Equatable, Identifiable {
```

If you run the code now you‚Äôll see twelve rows containing ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù ‚Äì something you might not have expected.

What‚Äôs changed is that we now have a _dynamic_ list, and our `ForEach` will execute the body of its closure ‚Äì three text views ‚Äì once for every item in our menu sections. We have four sections, and each one has been given three text views, so we end up with 12 in total.

To fix this, we‚Äôre going to ask for _one_ text view per section, and give it the name of our section to display:

```swift
List {
    ForEach(menu) { section in
        Text(section.name)
    }
}
```

Next let‚Äôs add the items inside each section. This is another `ForEach` inside the section `ForEach`, like this:

```swift
List {
    ForEach(menu) { section in
        Text(section.name)

        ForEach(section.items) { item in
            Text(item.name)
        }
    }
}
```

Now you‚Äôll see lots of table rows, with some containing section names (‚ÄúBreakfast‚Äù, ‚ÄúMains‚Äù, etc) and some containing menu item names (‚ÄúFull English‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuperfood Salad‚Äù, etc).

![Xcode showing a SwiftUI list with many items, and a navigation bar at the top. Next to it is the code required to make the preview.](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/2-5~dark.png)

While this works, it‚Äôs not ideal ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt create any visual structure in our table, so we‚Äôre going to break it up. The standard UIKit way of doing this is with table view sections, and SwiftUI gives us the `Section` view just for that. We can replace `Text(section.name)` with a Section using the section name for its title, which will be used as the text at the start of the section. The inner `ForEach` ‚Äì the one containing our menu items ‚Äì is then _inside_ the section, so SwiftUI will understand how we‚Äôve grouped things together.

The end result looks like this:

```swift
List {
    ForEach(menu) { section in
        Section(section.name) {
            ForEach(section.items) { item in
                Text(item.name)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By default SwiftUI‚Äôs lists use the ‚Äúinset grouped‚Äù style of `UITableView`, but we can change that by adding another modifier after `navigationTitle()`:

```swift
.listStyle(.grouped)
```
