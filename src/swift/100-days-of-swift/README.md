## How it works

Welcome to the 100 Days of Swift! This is a free collection of videos, tutorials, tests, and more, all drawn from around my existing work here on Hacking with Swift, and all designed to help you learn Swift.

It’s aimed squarely at beginners who want to learn to build real iOS apps, but struggle to find a good, free course that can help them achieve their goals. If that’s you, welcome – I hope you’re ready to show the iOS world what you’re made of!

__Important:__ There are two versions of the 100 Days course, this one and the newer [100 Days of SwiftUI][100-days-of-swiftui]. If you don’t know which one to follow, let me tell you up front: you should follow the 100 Days of SwiftUI. You should only follow this original version of the course if you specifically want to learn Apple’s older UIKit framework.

### Rules

If you want to make a success of this course, there are only two rules:

1. Every day you spend one hour reading or watching Swift tutorials, or writing Swift code.
2. Every day you post about your progress to the social media site of your choosing. Tell people!

I’ll be providing all the material you need to follow along, so all you need to do is show up ready to learn.

### Tips

I’ve met so many who have tried and failed to learn Swift, often multiple times, and if you’re here there’s a good chance you’ve already had a few false starts already.

Not this time. This time you’re going to learn it for real, and in just 100 days you’ll have built several full apps that you can be proud of.

You’ve already read the two rules of these 100 days, but to maximize your chance of rocking this course I have a few tips:

1. __It’s a marathon, not a sprint.__ Don’t charge ahead thinking you’re “learning faster”, because there’s a high chance you’ll get lost. Take your time!
2. __Don’t fall prey to shiny object syndrome.__ The lure of spending $50 on another course is high, I know, but you don’t learn anything by buying books. Your best chance of success is sticking with the 100 days shown here and really make it work.
3. __Don’t lone wolf it.__ You aren’t learning by yourself – I’m here to help as are many others. If you have questions, [tweet me at @twostraws][ask-me] and I’ll do my best to help!
4. __Use the consolidation days.__ These are spaced throughout the 100 days to give you time to review what you’ve learned and make it really sink in. Use them to go back over days you weren’t sure about, complete any homework you missed, or just do some free coding.
5. I have [a glossary of common Swift terms][glossary] that you should bookmark for easy reference.
6. [Download my Unwrap app from the App Store.](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1440611372) It works on iPhone and iPad, contains the first 12 days of this course plus lots of bonus activities, and is free with no in-app purchases.

## The Course

### Days 1-12: Introduction to Swift

The first 12 days provide a gentle warm up for your Swift learning. You’ll watch about a selection of one-minute videos every day, and complete short quizzes about each of those videos.

- [Day 1 – variables, simple data types, and string interpolation](01.md)
- [Day 2 – arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums](02.md)
- [Day 3 – operators and conditions](03.md)
- [Day 4 – loops, loops, and more loops](04.md)
- [Day 5 – functions, parameters, and errors](05.md)
- [Day 6 – closures part one](06.md)
- [Day 7 – closures part two](07.md)
- [Day 8 – structs, properties, and methods](08.md)

- [Day 12 – optionals, unwrapping, and typecasting](12.md)

### Days 13-15: Consolidation I

You just learned a lot about Swift in only 12 days, so before we continue it's important you reflect on what you've learned: look for weak spots, re-watch videos, re-take tests, and so on, until you feel comfortable that you have mastered all the Swift language fundamentals covered in days 1-12.

- [Day 13 – Swift review, day one](13.md)
- [Day 14 – Swift review, day two](14.md)
- [Day 15 – Swift review, day three](15.md)

### Day 23: Consolidation II

In the last few days we covered some of the fundamentals of iOS development, and before we move on to the next set of projects it’s important to take a step back and review what you’ve learned.

- [Day 23 – Milestone: Projects 1-3](23.md)

### Days 24-31: Web views, user input, and Auto Layout

The next three projects we’re looking at will push your iOS skills further as you create some user interface in code, manage table views more carefully, and get some experience with closures.

- [Day 41 – Milestone: Projects 7-9](41.md)
 
### Days 42-49: A whole new world

The next three projects we’ll be making are markedly different from the previous 9 – you’ll learn about making grids rather than tables, learn how to make high-performance 2D games using SpriteKit, and, at last, learn how to save user data.

- [Day 59](59.md) – Milestone: Projects 13-15
 
### Days 60-65: Maps and bugs

In the next three projects we’ll be edging a little further away from UIKit as we explore MapKit, Apple’s powerful and flexible mapping framework, then we’ll tackle a skill you’re more than ready for: debugging.
