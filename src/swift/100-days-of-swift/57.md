## Project 15, part one

Today we‚Äôre going to be looking at a fundamentally important part of iOS development: animation.

Years ago animation was often considered inconsequential ‚Äì it was there to make something look nice, rather than adding real value. But today we recognize that animation helps guide users through state changes in our app: when they delete an email it moved into the trash can, so they can see that it‚Äôs gone and know where to go if they want it back.

John Maeda, design lead at Automattic (the company behind Wordpress), put this rather succinctly: ‚ÄúDesign used to be the seasoning you‚Äôd sprinkle on for taste; now it‚Äôs the flour you need at the start of the recipe.‚Äù That means we need to be thinking about animation at the early stages of our app ‚Äì deciding how the user should interact with everything we show them needs to be at the core of our design.

Today is all about bringing your user interfaces to life with movement, scaling, rotation, and more. We‚Äôll be working in a sandbox, but you can use these principles anywhere!

__Today you have three topics to work through, and you‚Äôll learn about `animate(withDuration:)`, `CGAffineTransform`, `alpha`, and more.__

### Setting up

::: details Setting up

It's time to introduce one of the most important techniques in iOS development: animation. Sadly, many people don't consider animation important at all, which makes for some thoroughly awful user interface design.

Animation ‚Äì making things move, scale, and so on ‚Äì of your views is not only about making things pretty, although that's certainly a large part. Its main purpose is to give users a sense of what's changing and why, and it helps them make sense of a state change in your program.

When we use a navigation controller to show a new view controller, we don't just want it to appear. Instead, we want it to slide in, making it clear that the old screen hasn't gone away, it's just to the left of where we were.

You're almost certainly tired of hearing me say this, but iOS has a ridiculously powerful animation toolkit that's also easy to use. I know, I'm a broken record, right?

Well, don't just take my word for it ‚Äì let's try out some animation together so you can see exactly how it works. So, create a new Single View App project in Xcode, naming it Project15.

Please download the files for this project from [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/> `twostraws/HackingWithSwift`](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift) and copy its Content folder into your Xcode project. Finally, set it to work on landscape iPads only. Animation of course works on all devices and in all orientations, but it's easier to work with a fixed size for now.

### Preparing for action

::: details Preparing for action

[üìélink](https://hackingwithswift.com/read/15/2/preparing-for-action)

<YouTube id="ce5YR-M0QMw" />

Open Interface Builder with <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-file"/>`Main.storyboard` and place a button on there with the title "Tap" ‚Äì position it in the middle of the screen, near the bottom. Don‚Äôt worry that we‚Äôre positioning things using an iPhone XR-sized screen ‚Äì Auto Layout will automatically make it look great on iPads.

We want our button to always stay near the bottom of the view controller, so <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-drag from the button to the view directly below it and choose ‚ÄúBottom Space to Safe Area.‚Äù Now <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-drag the same way again and choose "Center Horizontally in Safe Area.‚Äù

That's it for Auto Layout, so please switch to the assistant view so we can add an action and an outlet. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-drag from the button to your code to create an action for the button called `tapped()`.

Every time the user taps the "Tap" button, we're going to execute a different animation. This will be accomplished by cycling through a counter, and moving an image view. To make all that work, you need to add two more properties to the class:

```swift
var imageView: UIImageView!
var currentAnimation = 0
```

There isn't an image view in the storyboard ‚Äì we're going to create it ourself in `viewDidLoad()` using an initializer that takes a `UIImage` and makes the image view the correct size for the image.

Add this code to `viewDidLoad()`:

```swift
imageView = UIImageView(image: UIImage(named: "penguin"))
imageView.center = CGPoint(x: 512, y: 384)
view.addSubview(imageView)
```

That places the penguin in the middle of an iPad-sized landscape screen, ready for us to animate.

There's one more thing we're going to do before we start looking at the animations, and that's to put a little bit of code into the `tapped()` method so that we cycle through animations each time the button is tapped. Put this in there:

```swift
currentAnimation += 1

if currentAnimation > 7 {
    currentAnimation = 0
}
```

That will add 1 to the value of `currentAnimation` until it reaches 7, at which point it will set it back to 0.

### Switch, case, animate: `animate(withDuration:)`

::: details Switch, case, animate: animate(withDuration:)

[üìélink](https://hackingwithswift.com/read/15/3/switch-case-animate-animatewithduration)

<YouTube id="nrp6SZWbRlY" />

The `currentAnimation` property can have a value between 0 and 7, each one triggering a different animation. We're going to create a big `switch/case` block inside `tapped()`, but we're going to start small and work our way up ‚Äì the `default` case will handle any values we don't explicitly catch.

This switch/case statement is going to go inside a new method of the `UIView` class called `animate(withDuration:)`, which is a kind of method you haven't seen before because it actually accepts two closures. The parameters we'll be using are how long to animate for, how long to pause before the animation starts, any options you want to provide, what animations to execute, and finally a closure that will execute when the animation finishes.

Update your `tapped()` method to this:

```swift
@IBAction func tapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    sender.isHidden = true

    UIView.animate(withDuration: 1, delay: 0, options: [],
       animations: {
        switch self.currentAnimation {
        case 0:
            break

        default:
            break
        }
    }) { finished in
        sender.isHidden = false
    }

    currentAnimation += 1

    if currentAnimation > 7 {
        currentAnimation = 0
    }
}
```

__Note__: Because we want to show and hide the ‚ÄúTap‚Äù button, we need to make the `sender` parameter to that method be a `UIButton` rather than `Any`.

All that code won't do anything yet, which is remarkable given that it's quite a lot! However, it has put us in a position where we can start dabbling with animations. But first, here's a breakdown of the code:

- When the method begins, we hide the `sender` button so that our animations don't collide; it gets unhidden in the completion closure of the animation.
- We call `animate(withDuration:)` with a duration of 1 second, no delay, and no interesting options.
- For the `animations` closure we _don‚Äôt_ need to use `[weak self]` because there‚Äôs no risk of strong reference cycles here ‚Äì the closures passed to `animate(withDuration:)` method will be used once then thrown away.
- We switch using the value of `self.currentAnimation`. We need to use `self` to make the closure capture clear, remember. This `switch/case` does nothing yet, because both possible cases just call `break`.
- We use trailing closure syntax to provide our completion closure. This will be called when the animation completes, and its `finished` value will be true if the animations completed fully.
- As I said, the completion closure unhides the `sender` button so it can be tapped again.
- After the `animate(withDuration:)` call, we have the old code to modify and wrap `currentAnimation`.

If you run the app now and tap the button, you'll notice it doesn't actually hide and show as you might expect. This is because UIKit detects that no animation has taken place, so it calls the completion closure straight away.

### Transform: `CGAffineTransform`

::: details Transform: CGAffineTransform

[üìélink](https://hackingwithswift.com/read/15/4/transform-cgaffinetransform)

<YouTube id="cQYbp4IGkgQ" />

Our code now has the perfect structure in place to let us dabble with animations freely, so it's time to learn about `CGAffineTransform`. This is a structure that represents a specific kind of transform that we can apply to any `UIView` object or subclass.

Unless you're into mathematics, affine transforms can seem like a black art. But Apple does provide some great helper functions to make it easier: there are functions to scale up a view, functions to rotate, functions to move, and functions to reset back to default.

All of these functions return a ``CGAffineTransform`` value that you can put into a view's `transform` property to apply it. As we'll be doing this inside an animation block, the transform will automatically be animated. This illustrates one of the many powerful things of Core Animation: you tell it what you want to happen, and it calculates all the intermediary states automatically.

Let's start with something simple: when we're at `currentAnimation` value 0, we want to make the view 2x its default size. Change the switch/case code to this:

```swift
switch self.currentAnimation {
case 0:
    self.imageView.transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 2, y: 2)

default:
    break
}
```

That uses an initializer for `CGAffineTransform` that takes an X and Y scale value as its two parameters. A value of 1 means "the default size," so `2, 2` will make the view twice its normal width and height. By default, UIKit animations have an "ease in, ease out" curve, which means the movement starts slow, accelerates, then slows down again before reaching the end.

Run the app now and tap the button to watch the penguin animate from 1x to 2x its size over one second, all by setting the transform inside an animation. You can keep tapping the button as many times more as you want, but nothing else will happen at this time. If you apply a 2x scale transform to a view that already has a 2x scale transform, nothing happens.

![When iOS draws the penguin at twice its size, it automatically smooths the image so it doesn't look too jaggy.](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/books/hws/15-1.png)

The next case is going to be 1, and we're going to use a special existing transform called `CGAffineTransform.identity`, or just `.identity`. This effectively clears our view of any pre-defined transform, resetting any changes that have been applied by modifying its `transform` property.

Add this to the switch/case statement after the existing case:

```swift
case 1:
    self.imageView.transform = .identity
For the sake of clarity, your code should now read:

switch self.currentAnimation {
case 0:
    self.imageView.transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 2, y: 2)

case 1:
    self.imageView.transform = .identity

default:
    break
}
```

With the second case in there, tapping the button repeatedly will first scale the penguin up, then scale it back down (resetting to defaults), then do nothing for lots of taps, then repeat the scale up/scale down. This is because our `currentAnimation` value is told to wrap (return to 0) when it's greater than 7, so the `default` case executes quite a few times.

Let's continue adding more cases: one to move the image view, then another to reset it back to the identity transform:

```swift
case 2:
    self.imageView.transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: -256, y: -256)

case 3:
    self.imageView.transform = .identity
```

That uses another new initializer for `CGAffineTransform` that takes X and Y values for its parameters. These values are _deltas_, or differences from the current value, meaning that the above code subtracts 256 from both the current X and Y position.

Tapping the button now will scale up then down, then move and return back to the center, all smoothly animated by Core Animation.

We can also use `CGAffineTransform` to rotate views, using its `rotationAngle` initializer. This accepts one parameter, which is the amount in radians you want to rotate. There are three catches to using this function:

1. You need to provide the value in radians specified as a `CGFloat`. This usually isn't a problem ‚Äì if you type 1.0 in there, Swift is smart enough to make that a `CGFloat` automatically. If you want to use a value like pi, use `CGFloat.pi`.
2. Core Animation will always take the shortest route to make the rotation work. So, if your object is straight and you rotate to 90 degrees (radians: half of pi), it will rotate clockwise. If your object is straight and you rotate to 270 degrees (radians: pi + half of pi) it will rotate counter-clockwise because it's the smallest possible animation.
3. A consequence of the second catch is that if you try to rotate 360 degrees (radians: pi times 2), Core Animation will calculate the shortest rotation to be "just don't move, because we're already there." The same goes for values over 360, for example if you try to rotate 540 degrees (one and a half full rotations), you'll end up with just a 180-degree rotation.
With all that in mind, here's are two more cases that show off rotation:

```swift
case 4:
    self.imageView.transform = CGAffineTransform(rotationAngle: CGFloat.pi)
case 5:
    self.imageView.transform = .identity
```

As well as animating transforms, Core Animation can animate many of the properties of your views. For example, it can animate the background color of the image view, or the level of transparency. You can even change multiple things at once if you want something more complicated to happen.

As an example, to make our view almost fade out then fade back in again while also changing its background color, we're going to modify its transparency by setting its `alpha` value, where 0 is invisible and 1 is fully visible, and also set its `backgroundColor` property ‚Äì first to green, then to clear.

Add these two new cases:

```swift
case 6:
    self.imageView.alpha = 0.1
    self.imageView.backgroundColor = UIColor.green

case 7:
    self.imageView.alpha = 1
    self.imageView.backgroundColor = UIColor.clear
```

That completes all possible cases, 0 to 7. But Core Animation isn't finished just yet. In fact, we've only scratched its surface in these tests, and there's much more it can do.

To give you the briefest glimpse of its power, replace this line of code:

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1, delay: 0, options: [],
```

‚Ä¶with this:

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1, delay: 0, usingSpringWithDamping: 0.5, initialSpringVelocity: 5, options: [],
```

This changes the `animate(withDuration:)` so that it uses spring animations rather than the default, ease-in-ease-out animation. I'm not even going to tell you what this does because I'm sure you're going to be impressed ‚Äì press Cmd+R to run the app and tap the button for yourself. We're done!
