## Core Graphics redux

Fred Donaldson has spent the last 40 years researching how and why children play, has taught at three US universities, written multiple books, and created a foundation to help teach his learning approach to the wider world.

One of the quotes he’s most famous for is this one: “Children learn as they play. Most importantly, in play children _learn how to learn._” That’s huge, if you stop and think about it: play helps teach kids the thing they are working with, but also deepens in them the concepts underlying all of learning itself.

Of course, play doesn’t apply just to kids – as George Bernard Shaw said, “we don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.” And so today’s second consolidation day is geared around giving you the space and time to play around with Core Graphics to see what you can do.

I’ve created a special Swift playground that walks you through a variety of Core Graphics techniques. However, I’ve made two versions, and it’s important you choose the right one.

__Today you should work through my Learn Core Graphics playground, either in Swift Playgrounds (preferred) or Xcode.__

Remember: experimentation like this is a powerful way to learn Core Graphics, but also learning how to learn in general. Enjoy it!

### If you have an iPad

Please install Apple’s “Swift Playgrounds” app from the App Store. It’s free, and allows you to experience my Core Graphics playground in its fullest.

Once you have Swift Playgrounds installed on your iPad, visit [https://www.hackingwithswift.com/playgrounds](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/playgrounds) on your iPad and click the big green “CLICK TO SUBSCRIBE” button. That should subscribe you to my source of Swift playgrounds.

Finally, select my Learn Core Graphics playground and dive in.

### If you do not have an iPad

I’ve made a special version of my Learn Core Graphics playground that works in Xcode 10.2 on your Mac. It doesn’t have all the same features because Xcode’s playground support isn’t as extensive as the Swift Playgrounds app, but it should still work great.

To try this approach, please download and run the playground from [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-select"/>here](http://hackingwithswift.com/files/playgrounds/Learn-Core-Graphics-Xcode.zip).
