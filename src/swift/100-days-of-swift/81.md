## Project 24, part two

If there‚Äôs one thing you need to know about language, it‚Äôs this: language is complicated. And that‚Äôs the number one reason why Swift‚Äôs strings are also complicated: they are designed to do the right thing by default, so you get support for all known languages, plus fantasy languages like Klingon and Elvish, and even emoji ‚Äì all without having to do anything special.

Although this might seem like a pointless technicality, you‚Äôd do well to remember this quote from Frank Chimero: ‚Äúpeople ignore design that ignores people.‚Äù Our job isn‚Äôt just to write great code and hope for the best, but instead to put our users needs front and centre all the time ‚Äì to make sure we meet their needs and solve their problems.

If your software falls on the first hurdle ‚Äì if it‚Äôs unable to handle their language ‚Äì then you might as well not bother.

__Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 24, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.__

Coming into this project you might thought strings were trivial, but I hope I‚Äôve shown you that there‚Äôs more to them than meets the eye.

We‚Äôve looked at how strings are different from arrays, how we can write useful extensions for strings, how Swift lets us combine functions together beautifully, and how `NSAttributedString` lets us add formatting to strings.

Of course, we‚Äôve only just scratched the surface of strings here, but the challenges below will encourage you to write some extensions of your own so you get a better feel for how it works.

#### Review what you learned

Anyone can sit through a tutorial, but it takes actual work to remember what was taught. It‚Äôs my job to make sure you take as much from these tutorials as possible, so I‚Äôve prepared a short review to help you check your learning.

[Click here to review what you learned in project 24.][project-24-swift-strings]

#### Challenge

One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try your new knowledge to make sure you fully understand what‚Äôs going on:

1. Create a `String` extension that adds a `withPrefix()` method. If the string already contains the prefix it should return itself; if it doesn‚Äôt contain the prefix, it should return itself with the prefix added. For example: `"pet".withPrefix("car")` should return ‚Äúcarpet‚Äù.
2. Create a `String` extension that adds an `isNumeric` property that returns true if the string holds any sort of number. Tip: creating a `Double` from a `String` is a failable initializer.
3. Create a `String` extension that adds a `lines` property that returns an array of all the lines in a string. So, ‚Äúthis\nis\na\ntest‚Äù should return an array with four elements.

That‚Äôs another project finished, and one that has given you a glimpse inside Swift‚Äôs inner working ‚Äì make sure you share the extensions you write with others!
