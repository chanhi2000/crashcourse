`ParsecT` is the main parser monad transformer and the central data type in `megaparsec`. `ParsecT e s m a` is parametrized like this:

- `e` is the type of custom component of error messages. If we do not want anything custom (and for now we do not), we just use `Void` from the `Data.Void` module.
- `s` is the type of input stream. `megaparsec` works out-of-the-box with `String`, strict and lazy `Text`, and strict and lazy `ByteStrings`. It is also possible to work with custom input streams.
- `m` is the inner monad of the `ParsecT` monad transformer.
- `a` is the monadic value, result of parsing.

Since most of the time `m` is nothing but `Identity`, the `Parsec` type synonym is quite useful:

```haskell
type Parsec e s a = ParsecT e s Identity a
```

`Parsec` is simply the non-transformer version of `ParsecT`.

We can also draw an analogy between the monad transformers in `megaparsec` and MTL monad transformers and classes. Indeed, there is also the `MonadParsec` type class which is similar in its purpose to type classes such as `MonadState` and `MonadReader`. We will return to `MonadParsec` [later](10.md) and discuss it in more details.

Speaking of type synonyms, the best way to start writing parser with `megaparsec` is to define a custom type synonym for your parser. This is a good idea for two reasons:

It will be easier to add top level signatures like `Parser Int` where `Parser` is your parsing monad. Without the signatures, things like `e` will often be ambiguous—it is the flip side of the polymorphic API of the library.

Working with concrete types with all type variables fixed helps GHC optimize a lot better. GHC cannot do much in terms of optimization if your parsers stay polymorphic. Although `megaparsec` API is polymorphic, it is expected that end user will stick to a concrete type of parsing monad, so inlining and the fact that most functions have their definition dumped into so-called interface files will allow GHC produce very efficient non-polymorphic code.

Let’s define a type synonym (typically called `Parser`) like this:

```haskell
type Parser = Parsec Void Text
--                   ^    ^
--                   |    |
-- Custom error component Type of input stream
```

Until we start dealing with custom parsing errors, when you see Parser in the chapter, assume this type.
