This is by no means a complete TH tutorial, some more rarely used tools and functions have not been covered. Still, the tutorial should get you up to speed and give a taste of what meta-programming in Haskell looks like. For further information refer directly to the Haddocks:

https://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell

The new th-abstraction package may also be of interest. It normalizes variations in the interface for inspecting datatype information between different versions of the template-haskell library.

Good luck!
