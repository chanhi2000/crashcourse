::: note Update

This Dagger 2 tutorial is now up to date with the latest version of Android Studio, version 3.0.1, and uses Kotlin for app development. Update by Dario Coletto. Original tutorial by Joe Howard.

:::

It turns out that Dependency Injection is nowhere near as complex as its name implies. And it is a key tool for building software systems that are maintainable and testable. In the end, relying on dependency injection will simplify your code quite a bit and also allow for a clearer path to writing testable code.

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll update an existing app named DroidWiki to use DI. The __DroidWiki__ app is a simple wikipedia client for android, based on __Dagger 2__ and __OkHttp 3__. The Wikipedia API is based on MediaWiki, and you can find the documentation [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page). These API are public and there is no need to get API keys or other stuff. But you should definitely check out [MediaWiki Etiquette](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Etiquette).

Hereâ€™s a quick peek at the search result screen in DroidWiki:

## Introduction

Before we begin, if you donâ€™t know what Dependency Injection is, hereâ€™s some great news: youâ€™re probably already using it without knowing it!

### What is Dependency Injection?

### Practical example of Dependency Injection

### The Dependency Inversion Principle

### How can Dagger 2 help with DI

---

## Getting Started

### MVP

### Dependencies in DroidWiki

---

## Configure the Project With Dagger 2

---

## Dagger 2 public APIs

### Module

### `@Provides` and `@Singleton`

### Component

---

## Your first (dependency) injection

### Update HomepageActivity

### The General Pattern

---

## Injecting the Network Graph

### NetworkModule

### Simplifying API builder

### WikiModule

### Update PresenterModule

### Update WikiApi

---

## Where to Go From Here?

A lot of developers asks themselves if all the changes youâ€™ve applied to the DroidWiki app are useful or not. Especially since everything was already working before implementing dependency injection. The utility of dependency injection and a framework like Dagger 2 become most evident in real-world production apps, where the dependency graph can get very complex.

Dagger 2 and dependency injection become especially useful when implementing proper testing into your app, allowing mock implementations of back-end APIs and data repositories to be used in testing.

Thereâ€™s much more to learn about in Dagger 2 and its usage, including:

- Scopes
- Subcomponents
- Testing with Mockito

There are many great resources out there on the interwebs to dive into these topics and one I must suggest is a __talk by Jake Wharton at DevOxx__, where you can get some more information about the history of DI on Android, some theory and some nice examples. As you do, happy injecting!
