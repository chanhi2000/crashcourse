In this course, you'll learn how to use Quarkus and JPAStreamer to build a REST web application. Quarkus is an open-source framework tailored for Java, optimized for building speedy cloud-native microservices and serverless applications, especially in containerized environments like Kubernetes. JPAStreamer, on the other hand, is a Java library that simplifies database interactions by allowing JPA entities to harness the expressiveness of Java Stream operations.
