## About This Course

CUDA is used to accelerate CPU-only applications by making them run on GPUs . These CUDA applications are massively parallel and way faster than their CPU-only counterparts. Experience C/C++ application acceleration by:

- Parallelizing applications to run on GPUs
- Optimizing applications by using CUDA techniques like memory - management
- Learning techniques like concurrency and CUDA streams
- Learning tools like Nsight Systems to profile and identify bottlenecks

Upon completion, you’ll be able to accelerate and optimize existing C/C++ CPU-only applications using the most essential CUDA techniques and Nsight Systems. You’ll understand an iterative style of CUDA development that will allow you to ship accelerated applications quickly.
