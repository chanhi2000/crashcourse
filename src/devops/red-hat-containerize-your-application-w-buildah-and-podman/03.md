## Cleaning the Containers

When you're done using a container, you can stop it using the command `podman stop` remove it using the command `podman rm`

The `podman stop` command stops the container runtime images. You can pass multiple image names as arguments if you want to stop multiple containers at once. For Example:

```sh
podman stop clumsy-bird moon-buggy
# 
# WARN[0010] StopSignal SIGTERM failed to stop container moon-buggy in 10 seconds, resorting to SIGKILL 
# clumsy-bird
# moon-buggy
```

The `podman rm` command permanently deletes the container runtime images, and as similar to `podman stop` can have multiple image names as arguments. For Example:

```sh
podman rm clumsy-bird moon-buggy
# moon-buggy
# clumsy-bird
```
