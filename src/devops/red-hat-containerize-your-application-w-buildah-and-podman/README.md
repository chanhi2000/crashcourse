## An Overview of Container Tools

In this track, we'll explore the basics of Buildah and Podman and learn how to use them to build, run, and share container images with examples of deploying two games.

Before, We move on let us understand Buildah, Podman and UBI.

- Buildah: A tool for building OCI container images
- Podman: A tool for running and managing containers
- UBI: A Universal Base Image that provides a stable foundation for building containerized applications.

Moon-buggy and Clumsy Bird are two games used as examples for deploying and containerizing applications using Buildah and Podman. Moon-Buggy is a text-based game played in the command line interface (CLI), while Clumsy-Bird is a web-based game.
