## Background

This lab will help give you a basic understanding of how to use some other OCI compliant tools such as Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo.

By the end of this lab you should be able to:

- FIND, RUN, BUILD, and SHARE containers using OCI compliant tools
- Solve real technical problems by using a small set of daemonless tools
- Be comfortable using with the basics of an alternative set of tools to Docker

---

## Outline

- Understanding the difference between RHEL Server and CoreOS, as well as the difference between the fast and stable streams provided in RHEL Server
- Understanding how to install the fast and stable streams
- Podman: Familiar Territory: Learning the basics of how to use podman
- Buildah: Granularity & Control: Understanding how a container image is really built
- Skopeo: Moving & Sharing: Simplicity in inspecting, and moving container images around
- CRIU: Checkpoint and restore the memory contents of containers
- Udica: Build and deploy custom SELinux policies for containers
- OSCAP-Podman: verify patched or unpatched vulnerabilities in container images produced by Red Hat
