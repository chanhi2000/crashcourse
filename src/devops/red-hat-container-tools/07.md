The default Containers SELinux policy does a really good job Podman in RHEL 8. Most containers "just work" but like any security tool, every now and then we need to make some customizations. Sometimes, especially as we expand the types of workloads that we run in containers, we bump into places where SELinux blocks us. Udica allows an administrator to customize the SELinux policy specifically for a workload for without being an SELinux expert.

For example, run the following container:

::: tabs

@tab:active Input

```sh
podman run --name home-test --privileged -v /home/:/home:ro -it ubi8 ls /home
```

@tab Result

```sh
# Error: OCI runtime error: runc: container_linux.go:349: starting container process caused "unknown capability \"CAP_BPF\""
```

:::

The above command will fail because the default SELinux policy does not allow containers to mount /home as read only. We can verify that there are no allow rules which permit this command to be executed:

::: tabs

@tab:active Input

```sh
sesearch -A -s container_t -t home_root_t -c dir -p read
```

@tab Result

```sh
```

:::

With Udica, we can quickly and easily configure SELinxux to allow us to mount /home as root. First, we have to extract the meta-data from our container:

```sh
podman inspect home-test > home-test.json
```

Now, Udica will analyze this data and create a custom SELinux policy for us:

::: tabs

@tab:active Input

```sh
udica -j home-test.json home_test
```

@tab Result

```sh
# Policy home_test created!
# 
# Please load these modules using: 
# # semodule -i home_test.cil /usr/share/udica/templates/{base_container.cil,home_container.cil}
# 
# Restart the container with: "--security-opt label=type:home_test.process" parameter
```

:::

Use the SELinux tools to load the new policy:

::: tabs

@tab:active Input

```sh
semodule -i home_test.cil /usr/share/udica/templates/{base_container.cil,home_container.cil}
```

@tab Result

```sh
```

:::

Now, run the same type of container again, but pass it a security option telling it to label the process to use our new custom policy, and it will execute without being blocked. First start the contaier:

::: tabs

@tab:active Input

```sh
podman run --name home-test-2 --privileged --security-opt label=type:home_test.process -v /home/:/home:ro -id ubi8 bash
```

@tab Result

```sh
```

:::

Execute the `ls` command:

::: tabs

@tab:active Input

```sh
podman exec -it home-test-2 ls /home
```

@tab Result

```sh
# Error: can only create exec sessions on running containers: container state improper
```

:::

You will notice that the process is running with the "home_test.process" SELinux context:

::: tabs

@tab:active Input

```sh
ps -efZ | grep home_test
```

@tab Result

```sh
# system_u:system_r:unconfined_service_t:s0 root 9611 9134  0 09:23 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto home_test
```

:::

We can also verify that there is a new rule in this policy to allow our container to mount /home read only:

::: tabs

@tab:active Input

```sh
sesearch -A -s home_test.process -t home_root_t -c dir -p read
```

@tab Result

```sh
# allow home_test.process home_root_t:dir { getattr ioctl lock open read search };
```

## Conclusions

It's always best to have SELinux enabled, especially with containers. It's so easy to create a custom SELinux policy with Udica, that you should never disable it. If you'd like to understand Udica a bit deeper, check out this great article, [Use `udica` to build SELinux policy for containers](https://fedoramagazine.org/use-udica-to-build-selinux-policy-for-containers/) by Lukas Vrabec. Now, let's move on to another tool.
