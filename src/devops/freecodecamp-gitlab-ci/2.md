## 2.1 Unit overview

- we will start working on a simple website project
- we want to automate any of the manual steps required for integrating the changes of multiple developers
- we will create a pipeline that will build and test the software we are creating

---

## 2.2 Your first GitLab project

- we will try to automate the build and deployment of a simple website project build with JavaScript using the React framework
- forking allows making a copy of a project
- the key to automation is to be familiar with the CLI tools we plan to use in GitLab CI

## 2.3 Building the project

- most software projects have a build step where code is compiled or prepared for production-use
- yarn is a Node.js package manager that helps with managing the project by running scripts and installing dependencies
- for a Node.js project, the `node_modules` folder contains all project dependencies
- project dependencies are installed using `yarn install` but are NOT stored in the Git repository
- it is really a bad idea to store project dependencies in the code repository
- image tags that contain `alpine` or `slim` are smaller in size as they use a lightweight Linux distribution

```yml
build website:
  image: node:16-alpine
  script:
    - yarn install
    - yarn build
```

- [Yarn CLI documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/cli)

---

## 2.4 Assignment

- Create a job to verify that the build folder contains a file named index.html
- Create another job that runs the project unit tests using the command yarn test

---

## 2.5 Assignment solution

::: details My solution to the assignment

<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-gitlab"/> `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yml
stages:
  - build
  - test

build website:
image: node:16-alpine
stage: build
script:
  - yarn install
  - yarn build
artifacts:
  paths:
    - build

test website:
  image: alpine
  stage: test
  script:
    - test -f build/index.html

unit tests:
  image: node:16-alpine
  stage: test
  script:
    - yarn install
    - yarn test
```

## 2.6 How do we integrate changes?

- we use Git to keep track of code changes
- we need to ensure we don't break the main pipeline

> Git for Gitlab

---

## 2.7 Merge requests

- we need to ensure that the chances of breaking the main branch are reduced
- here are some project settings for working with Merge Requests that I recommend:
  - Go to `[Settings]` > `[Merge requests]`
  - Merge method > select *Fast-forward merge*
  - Squash commits when merging > select *Encourage*
  - Merge checks > check *Pipelines must succeed*
- protect the master by allowing changes only through a merge request: 
  - `[Settings]` > `[Repository]` > Branch main > Allowed to push - select *No one*

  script:
    - yarn install
    - yarn test

## 2.8 Code review

- merge requests are often used to review the work before merging it
- merge requests allow us to document why a specific change was made
- other people on the team can review the changes and share their feedback by commenting
- if you still need to make changes from the merge request, you can open the branch using the Web IDE

---

## 2.9 Integration tests

- before we ship the final product, we try to test it to see if it works
- testing is done of various levels but high-level tests typically include integration and acceptance tests
- we use cURL to create an HTTP call to the website

## 2.10 How to structure a pipeline

- our current pipeline structure is just an example, not a rule
- there are a few principles to consider

### principle #1: Fail fast

- we want to ensure that the most common reasons why a pipeline would fail are detected early
- put jobs of the same size in the same stage

### principle #2: Job dependencies

- you need to understand the dependencies between the jobs
- example: you can't test what was not already built yet
- if jobs have dependencies between them, they need to be in distinct stages
