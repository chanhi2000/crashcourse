If the string already contains the prefix it should return itself; if it doesn‚Äôt contain the prefix, it should return itself with the prefix added. For example: <code>&quot;pet&quot;.withPrefix(&quot;car&quot;)</code> should return ‚Äúcarpet‚Äù.</li><li>Create a <code>String</code> extension that adds an <code>isNumeric</code> property that returns true if the string holds any sort of number. Tip: creating a <code>Double</code> from a <code>String</code> is a failable initializer.</li><li>Create a <code>String</code> extension that adds a <code>lines</code> property that returns an array of all the lines in a string. So, ‚Äúthis\\nis\\na\\ntest‚Äù should return an array with four elements.</li></ol>',9),N=t("div",{class:"hint-container info"},[t("p",{class:"hint-container-title"},"Wrap up - Additional"),t("p",null,[t("a",{href:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review/hws/project-24-swift-strings",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"Review for Project 24: Swift Strings")])],-1),V=t("p",null,"That‚Äôs another project finished, and one that has given you a glimpse inside Swift‚Äôs inner working ‚Äì make sure you share the extensions you write with others!",-1),W=t("hr",null,null,-1);function I(h,R){const a=o("router-link"),r=o("VPCard"),c=o("VidStack");return f(),u("div",null,[t("h1",m,[t("a",y,[t("span",null,d(h.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),t("nav",_,[t("ul",null,[t("li",null,[e(a,{to:"#project-24-part-two"},{default:n(()=>[l("Project 24, part two")]),_:1}),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,[e(a,{to:"#wrap-up"},{default:n(()=>[l("Wrap up")]),_:1})])])])])]),k,e(r,i(s({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 81",desc:"Project 24, part two",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/81",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),b,v,x,j,S,D,t("details",C,[P,e(r,i(s({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 81 - Wrap up",desc:"Wrap up",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/24/5/wrap-up",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),e(c,{src:"youtube/yzq0jaNsutE"}),T]),N,V,W])}const z=p(g,[["render",I],["__file","81.html.vue"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"path":"/swift/100-days-of-swift/81.html","title":"Day 81","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Day 81","description":"100 Days of Swift > Day 81","category":["Swift"],"tag":["crashcourse","paul-hudson","swift","hacking-with-swift","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 81"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Day 81"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/81.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/81.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ü•ÅCrashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Day 81"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 81"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"paul-hudson"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hacking-with-swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Day 81\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Project 24, part two","slug":"project-24-part-two","link":"#project-24-part-two","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Wrap up","slug":"wrap-up","link":"#wrap-up","children":[]}]}],"git":{"createdTime":1703665357000,"updatedTime":1727918413000,"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":12}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.19,"words":656},"filePathRelative":"swift/100-days-of-swift/81.md","localizedDate":"2023ÎÖÑ 12Ïõî 27Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n\\n<hr>\\n"}');export{z as comp,K as data};
