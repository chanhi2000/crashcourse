Software Distribution</span></a></h2><p>Your system is comprised of many packages such as internet browsers, text editors, media players, etc. These packages are managed via package managers, which install and maintain the software on your system. Not all packages are installed through package managers though, you can commonly install packages directly from their source code (we&#39;ll get to that soon). However the majority of the time you will use a package manager to install software, the most common variety of packages are Debian (<code>.deb</code>) and Red Hat (<code>.rpm</code>). Debian style packages are used in distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, LinuxMint, etc. Red Hat style packages are seen in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS, etc.</p><p>What are packages? You may know them as Chrome, Photoshop, etc and they are, but what they really are just lots and lots of files that have been compiled into one. The people (or sometimes a single person) that write this software are known as <strong>upstream providers</strong>, they compile their code and write up how to get it installed. These upstream providers work on getting out new software and update existing software. When they are ready to release it to the world, they send their package to <strong>package maintainers</strong>, who handle getting this piece of software in the hands of the users. These package maintainers review, manage and distribute this software in the form of packages.</p><hr><h2 id="_2-package-repositories" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-package-repositories"><span>2. Package Repositories</span></a></h2><p>How do packages that get uploaded to the internet somehow end up on our computers? Do you go to the download page of each package you want and click download and install? Well, actually you can do that, but there is something better called package repositories. Repositories are just a central storage location for packages. There are tons of repositories that hold lots of packages and best of all they are all found on the internet, no silly installation disks. Your machine doesn&#39;t know where to look for these repositories unless you explicitly tell it where to look.</p>',7),_={href:"http://download.widgets/linux/deb/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},x=e("code",null,"http://download.widgets/linux/deb/",-1),z=e("p",null,"Now instead of going to their website to download the package directly, you can tell your machine to find WackyWidgets software from the source link.",-1),j=e("code",null,"/etc/apt/sources.list",-1),P=l(`<hr><h2 id="_3-tar-and-gzip" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-tar-and-gzip"><span>3. <code>tar</code> and <code>gzip</code></span></a></h2><p>Before we get into package installation and the different managers, we need to discuss archiving and compressing files, because you will most likely encounter these when you hunt for software on the internet.</p><p>You probably already know what a file archive is, you&#39;ve most likely encountered file types such as <code>.rar</code> and <code>.zip</code>.

Package Dependencies</span></a></h2><p>Packages very rarely work by themselves, they are most often accompanied by dependencies to help them run. For example, let&#39;s say we have a group of restaurants, these restaurants all make different cuisine, however they all get their ingredients from the same farm. Their food is dependent on the farm&#39;s supplies, if the farm were to suddenly stop supplying food, well then the restaurants would be in a pretty bad state.</p><p>In Linux, these dependencies are often other packages or shared libraries. Shared libraries are libraries of code that other programs want to use and don&#39;t want to have to rewrite for themselves. Think of the restaurant again, how much work would it be if every restaurant also farmed their own food? Too much.</p><p>We will dig more into shared libraries in the filesystem course, so for now just remember that packages have dependencies to help them run, whether those dependencies are other packages or libraries, if the dependencies aren&#39;t there the package will end up in a broken state and most of the time not even install.</p><hr><h2 id="_5-rpm-and-dpkg" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-rpm-and-dpkg"><span>5. <code>rpm</code> and <code>dpkg</code></span></a></h2><p>Although most of this course is about package management systems (the Batmans of package management), we mustn&#39;t forget about the Robins. Although very useful and reliable, they don&#39;t come with that sweet batmobile and utility belt.</p><p>Just like .exe is a single executable file, so is <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code>. You normally wouldn&#39;t see these if you use package repositories, but if you directly download packages, you will most likely get them in these popular format. Obviously, they are exclusive to their distributions, <code>.deb</code> for Debian based and .rpm for Red Hat based.</p><p>To install these direct packages, you can use the package management commands: rpm and dpkg. These tools are used to install package files, however they will not install the package dependencies, so if your package had 10 dependencies, you would have to install those packages separately and then their dependencies and so on and so forth. As you can see, that was one of the reasons that brought forth the full blown management systems that we will discuss this later.</p><p>Keep in mind that there will be countless times when you need to install, query or verify a package with one of these tools, so remember these commands.</p><h3 id="install-a-package" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#install-a-package"><span>Install a package</span></a></h3><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre><code><span class="line">dpkg <span class="token parameter variable">-i</span> some_deb_package.deb <span class="token comment"># Debian</span></span>
