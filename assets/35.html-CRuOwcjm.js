Sure, our specific version was about one feed, but the concepts ‚Äì fetching data, using <code>Codable</code>, rendering things into a web view, etc ‚Äì are applicable anywhere.</p><p>But you‚Äôve done more than just learn some new coding techniques. Michelle Obama once said ‚Äúthrough my education, I didn&#39;t just develop skills, I didn&#39;t just develop the ability to learn, but I developed confidence.‚Äù And that‚Äôs true of you, too: each time you complete these projects you add another completed project to your r√©sum√© and you add another load of skills to your toolkit, but you‚Äôre also building the confidence that when you face a similar problem in the future you‚Äôll realize you can look back on your work these last few days and have an instant refresher.</p><p>And it <em>is</em> a refresher. You see, you won‚Äôt remember the precise code you wrote today, and you might even forget class names like <code>JSONDecoder</code>. But that‚Äôs OK: being a skilled developer isn‚Äôt about memorizing classes or methods ‚Äì it‚Äôs about knowing <em>concepts</em>. And if you‚Äôre able to apply the concepts from this project with some concepts from projects 2, 4, and 5 to make something entirely new, then you‚Äôre doing a great job.</p><p><strong>Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 7, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.</strong></p><h3 id="wrap-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wrap-up"><span>Wrap up</span></a></h3>',6),_={class:"hint-container details"},j=e("summary",null,"Wrap up",-1),S=h('<p>As your Swift skill increases, I hope you&#39;re starting to feel the balance of these projects move away from explaining the basics and toward presenting and dissecting code.</p><p>In this project you learned how to download JSON using Swift‚Äôs Data type, then use the Codable protocol to convert that data into Swift objects we defined. Working with JSON is something you&#39;re going to be doing time and time again in your Swift career, and you&#39;ve cracked it in about an hour of work ‚Äì while also learning about <code>UITabBarController</code>, <code>UIStoryboard</code>, and more.</p><p>Good job!</p><h4 id="review-what-you-learned" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#review-what-you-learned"><span>Review what you learned</span></a></h4><p>Anyone can sit through a tutorial, but it takes actual work to remember what was taught. It‚Äôs my job to make sure you take as much from these tutorials as possible, so I‚Äôve prepared a short review to help you check your learning.</p><p><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review/hws/project-7-whitehouse-petitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to review what you learned in project 7.</a></p><h4 id="challenge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#challenge"><span>Challenge</span></a></h4><p>One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully understand what‚Äôs going on:</p><ol><li>Add a Credits button to the top-right corner using <code>UIBarButtonItem</code>. When this is tapped, show an alert telling users the data comes from the We The People API of the Whitehouse.</li><li>Let users filter the petitions they see. This involves creating a second array of filtered items that contains only petitions matching a string the user entered. Use a <code>UIAlertController</code> with a text field to let them enter that string. This is a tough one, so I‚Äôve included some hints below if you get stuck.</li><li>Experiment with the HTML ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt a HTML or CSS tutorial, but you can find lots of resources online to give you enough knowledge to tinker with the layout a little.</li></ol><h4 id="hints" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hints"><span>Hints</span></a></h4><p>It is <em>vital</em> to your learning that you try the challenges above yourself, and not just for a handful of minutes before you give up.</p><p>Every time you try something wrong, you learn that it‚Äôs wrong and you‚Äôll remember that it‚Äôs wrong. By the time you find the <em>correct</em> solution, you‚Äôll remember it much more thoroughly, while also remembering a lot of the wrong turns you took.</p><p>This is what I mean by ‚Äúthere is no learning without struggle‚Äù: if something comes easily to you, it can go just as easily. But when you have to really mentally fight for something, it will stick much longer.</p><p>But if you‚Äôve already worked hard at the challenges above and are still struggling to implement them, I‚Äôm going to write some hints below that should guide you to the correct answer.</p><p><strong>If you ignore me and read these hints without having spent at least 30 minutes trying the challenges above, the only person you‚Äôre cheating is yourself.</strong></p><p>Still here? OK. The second challenge here is to let users filter the petitions they see. To solve this you need to do a number of things:</p><ol><li>Have one property to store all petitions, and one to store filtered petitions. This means the user can filter the petitions several times and you don‚Äôt have to keep redownloading your JSON.</li><li>At first your filtered petitions array will be the same as the main petitions array, so just assign one to the other when your data is ready.</li><li>Your table view should load all its data from the filtered petitions array.</li><li>You‚Äôll need a bar button item to show an alert controller that the user can type into.</li><li>Once that‚Äôs done, go through all the items in your petitions array, adding any you want to the filtered petition.</li></ol><p>The important part here is the last one: how do you decide whether a petition matches the user‚Äôs search? One option is to use <code>contains()</code> to check whether the petition title or body text contains the user‚Äôs search string ‚Äì try it and see how you get on!</p>',18),x=e("div",{class:"hint-container info"},[e("p",{class:"hint-container-title"},"Wrap up - Additional"),e("p",null,[e("a",{href:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review/hws/project-7-whitehouse-petitions",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"Review for Project 7: Whitehouse Petitions")])],-1),D=e("p",null,"Once you‚Äôre done, tell other people: you‚Äôve built another great app for iOS, and you‚Äôve learned more about parsing JSON, tab bar controllers, and more.",-1),I=e("p",null,"You should be proud of what you‚Äôve accomplished ‚Äì keep going!",-1),T=e("hr",null,null,-1);function O(c,C){const a=o("router-link"),r=o("VPCard"),p=o("VidStack");return m(),u("div",null,[e("h1",w,[e("a",f,[e("span",null,y(c.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),e("nav",b,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#project-7-part-three"},{default:i(()=>[l("Project 7, part three")]),_:1}),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#wrap-up"},{default:i(()=>[l("Wrap up")]),_:1})])])])])]),k,t(r,n(s({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 35",desc:"Project 7, part three",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/35",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),v,e("details",_,[j,t(r,n(s({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 35 - Wrap up",desc:"Wrap up",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/7/6/wrap-up",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),t(p,{src:"youtube/utUpNqglZGs"}),S]),x,D,I,T])}const W=d(g,[["render",O],["__file","35.html.vue"]]),A=JSON.parse('{"path":"/swift/100-days-of-swift/35.html","title":"Day 35","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Day 35","description":"100 Days of Swift > Day 35","category":["Swift"],"tag":["crashcourse","paul-hudson","swift","hacking-with-swift","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 35"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Day 35"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/35.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/35.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ü•ÅCrashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Day 35"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 35"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"paul-hudson"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hacking-with-swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Day 35\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Project 7, part three","slug":"project-7-part-three","link":"#project-7-part-three","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Wrap up","slug":"wrap-up","link":"#wrap-up","children":[]}]}],"git":{"createdTime":1703642364000,"updatedTime":1727918413000,"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":9}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":3.79,"words":1138},"filePathRelative":"swift/100-days-of-swift/35.md","localizedDate":"2023ÎÖÑ 12Ïõî 27Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n\\n<hr>\\n"}');export{W as comp,A as data};
