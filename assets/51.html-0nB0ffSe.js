So, today we‚Äôre going to do something a little different: I want to give you a sense of the broader Swift ecosystem.</p><p>I <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/165/the-best-swift-and-ios-conferences-in-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">often</a> <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/152/conference-report-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">write</a> about <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/48/top-swift-and-ios-conferences-in-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conferences</a>, because I believe most people benefit from getting out there and meeting other people, hearing fresh ideas, and playing an active role in the community.</p><p>While you‚Äôre just learning it‚Äôs easy to miss just how interesting our community is, so today I would you like you to watch two talks I‚Äôve given at conferences last year: dotSwift in Paris and NSSpain in Logro√±o.</p><p>I‚Äôve picked out these talks for different reasons:</p><ul><li>At this point in your learning, the dotSwift talk will be totally within your grasp, but will still inspire you to write better Swift code.</li><li>The NSSpain talk will about 70% in your grasp, and about 30% new, but I think at this point you‚Äôll appreciate some of the many pain points I talk about.</li></ul><p>Don‚Äôt worry if there are some things you don‚Äôt fully understand yet. When you listen to a conference talk, very often you‚Äôll know some things already, learn a few things quickly, and have to do some extra research on others ‚Äì that‚Äôs normal, and it shows that it hit the sweet spot.</p><p>As I write this, I spoke to someone just yesterday who said they attended a conference in 2018 and then again in 2019, and it was amazing for them to see how much more they understood after a year of work. As Leonardo da Vinci said, ‚Äúthe noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding,‚Äù and I can think of few better yardsticks of your progress than watching talks live or recorded and realizing they are starting to make more sense than before.</p><p>Hopefully this video day gives you a little time to catch your breath, while also giving you just a taste of what else is out there.</p><p><strong>Today you have two videos to watch, and you‚Äôll learn about <code>map()</code>, <code>flatMap()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, and more.</strong></p>',10),S=t("blockquote",null,[t("p",null,"Elements of Functional Programming")],-1),x=t("blockquote",null,[t("p",null,"Teaching Swift at Scale")],-1),D=t("hr",null,null,-1);function z(a,I){const n=o("router-link"),i=o("VPCard"),r=o("VidStack"),s=o("VideoPlayer");return y(),l("div",null,[t("h1",w,[t("a",_,[t("span",null,h(a.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),t("nav",k,[t("ul",null,[t("li",null,[e(n,{to:"#expanding-your-horizons"},{default:p(()=>[m("Expanding your horizons")]),_:1})])])]),b,e(i,d(u({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 51",desc:"Expanding your horizons",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/51",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),v,e(r,{src:"youtube/OgU8d_E1K14"}),S,e(s,{src:"https://vimeo.com/291590798"}),x,D])}const P=c(g,[["render",z],["__file","51.html.vue"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"path":"/swift/100-days-of-swift/51.html","title":"Day 51","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Day 51","description":"100 Days of Swift > Day 51","category":["Swift"],"tag":["crashcourse","paul-hudson","swift","hacking-with-swift","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 51"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Day 51"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/51.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/51.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ü•ÅCrashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Day 51"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 51"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"paul-hudson"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hacking-with-swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Day 51\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Expanding your horizons","slug":"expanding-your-horizons","link":"#expanding-your-horizons","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1703642364000,"updatedTime":1727918413000,"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":10}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.62,"words":487},"filePathRelative":"swift/100-days-of-swift/51.md","localizedDate":"2023ÎÖÑ 12Ïõî 27Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n\\n<hr>\\n"}');export{P as comp,E as data};
