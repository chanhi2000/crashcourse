You‚Äôre now a developer on Apple‚Äôs platforms, and it behoves you to attempt to follow in their footsteps: put the user in control, respect their settings, and treat their data with respect.</p><p>Today you‚Äôre going to be taking on some challenges to do with notifications, but when you‚Äôre doing it I want you to keep in mind what I said above: don‚Äôt abuse the trust users have placed in us, and remember that millions of apps have shipped before you that worked hard to maintain Apple‚Äôs high standards. You‚Äôre part of that now and I hope you feel increasingly able to rise to match that heritage.</p><p><strong>Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 21, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.</strong></p><h3 id="wrap-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wrap-up"><span>Wrap up</span></a></h3>',7),b={class:"hint-container details"},j=e("summary",null,"Wrap up",-1),A=l('<p>That was easy, right? And yet it&#39;s such a great feature to have, because now your app can talk to users even when it isn&#39;t running. You want to show a step count for how far they&#39;ve walked? Use a notification. You want to trigger an alert because it&#39;s their turn to play in a game? Use a notification. You want to send them marketing messages to make them buy more stuff?

Give it the title ‚ÄúRemind me later‚Äù, and make it call <code>scheduleLocal()</code> so that the same alert is shown in 24 hours. (For the purpose of these challenges, a time interval notification with 86400 seconds is good enough ‚Äì that‚Äôs roughly how many seconds there are in a day, excluding summer time changes and leap seconds.)</li><li>And for an even harder challenge, update project 2 so that it reminds players to come back and play every day. This means scheduling a week of notifications ahead of time, each of which launch the app. When the app is finally launched, make sure you call <code>removeAllPendingNotificationRequests()</code> to clear any un-shown alerts, then make new alerts for future days.</li></ol>',9),D=e("div",{class:"hint-container info"},[e("p",{class:"hint-container-title"},"Wrap up - Additional"),e("p",null,[e("a",{href:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review/hws/project-21-local-notifications",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"Review for Project 21: Local Notifications")])],-1),x=e("p",null,"That‚Äôs another project finished, and one that teaches you a technique you‚Äôll come back to time and time again.
