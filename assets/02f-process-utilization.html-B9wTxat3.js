Process Threads</span></a></h2><p>You may have heard of the terms single-threaded and multi-threaded processes. Threads are very similar to processes, in that they are used to execute the same program, they are often referred to as lightweight processes. If a process has one thread it is single-threaded and if a process has more than one thread it is multi-threaded. However, all processes have at least one thread.</p><p>Processes operate with their own isolated system resources, however threads can share these resources among each other easily, making it easier for them to communicate among each other and at times it is more efficient to have a multi-threaded application than a multi-process application.</p><p>Basically, let&#39;s say you open up LibreOffice Writer and Chrome, each is it&#39;s own separate process. Now you go inside Writer and start editing text, when you edit the text it gets automatically saved. These two parallel &quot;<em>lightweight processes</em>&quot; of saving and editing are threads.</p><p>To view process threads, you can use:</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token function">ps</span> m</span>

Load averages are good way to see the CPU load on your system. These numbers represent the average CPU load in 1, 5, and 15 minute intervals. What do I mean by CPU load, the CPU load is the average number of processes that are waiting to be executed by the CPU.</p><p>Let&#39;s say you have a single-core CPU, think of this core as a single lane in traffic. If it&#39;s rush hour on the freeway, this lane is gonna be really busy and traffic is gonna be at 100% or a load of 1. Now the traffic has become so bad, it&#39;s backing up the freeway and getting the regular roads busy by twice the amount of cars, we can say that your load is 200% or a load of 2. Now let&#39;s say it clears up a bit and there are only half as many cars on the freeway lane, we can say the load of the lane is 0.5. When traffic is non-existent and we can get home quicker, the load should ideally be very low, like 2am traffic low. The cars in this case are processes and these processes are just waiting to get off the freeway and get home.</p><p>Now just because you have a load average of 1 doesn&#39;t mean your computer is slogging around. Most modern machines these days have multiple cores. If you had a quad core processor (4 cores) and your load average is 1, it&#39;s really just affecting 25% of your CPU. Think of each core as a lane in traffic. You can view the amount of cores you have on your system with <code>cat /proc/cpuinfo</code>.</p><p>When observing load average, you have to take the number of cores into account, if you find that your machine is always using an above average load, there could something wrong going on.</p><p>Check the load average of your system and see what it&#39;s doing.</p><hr><h2 id="_5-i-o-monitoring" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-i-o-monitoring"><span>5.
