Tell people!</li></ol><p>I’ll be providing all the material you need to follow along, so all you need to do is show up ready to learn. I’ve even provided a “Tweet” button at the end of every day, which composes a tweet for you saying you completed the day, and includes the hashtag to help others find you, a celebratory graphic, and a link for others to find out more – use it!</p><p>I’ve tried to make sure it takes less than one hour to complete each day, but there is a little natural variation. For example, day 4 is a little shorter because it has less ground to cover, and day 13 is a little longer because it has a few complex topics inside.</p><h3 id="tips" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tips"><span>Tips</span></a></h3><p>I’ve met so many who have tried and failed to learn Swift, often multiple times, and if you’re here there’s a good chance you’ve already had a few false starts already.</p><p>Not this time. This time you’re going to learn it for real, and in just 100 days you’ll have built many full apps that you can be proud of.</p><p>You’ve already read the two rules of these 100 days, but to maximize your chance of rocking this course I have a few tips:</p><ol><li><strong>It’s a marathon, not a sprint.</strong> Don’t charge ahead thinking you’re “learning faster”, because there’s a high chance you’ll get lost. Take your time!</li><li><strong>Don’t fall prey to shiny object syndrome.</strong> The lure of spending $100 on another course is high, I know, but you don’t learn anything by buying books. Your best chance of success is sticking with the 100 days shown here and really make it work, so if you’re already thinking “I can do this course at the same time as Other SwiftUI Course” you’re just setting yourself up to fail.</li><li><strong>Don’t lone wolf it.</strong> You aren’t learning by yourself – I’m here to help as are many others. If you have questions, <a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet me at @twostraws</a> and I’ll do my best to help!</li><li><strong>Use the consolidation days.</strong> These are spaced throughout the 100 days to give you time to review what you’ve learned and make it really sink in.
