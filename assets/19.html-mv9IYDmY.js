You can set these values exactly by using the size inspector in the top-right of the Xcode window.</p><figure><img src="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/books/hws/2-4.png" alt="Draw three buttons onto your view." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Draw three buttons onto your view.</figcaption></figure><p>In the early days of iOS, buttons had a white background color and rounded edges so they were visibly tappable, but these days buttons are completely flat with just some text.

This might seem strange, but it’s a little bit of iOS magic that takes away a huge amount of work from developers.</p><p>Early iOS devices had non-retina screens. This meant a screen resolution of 320x480 pixels, and you could place things exactly where you wanted them – you asked for 10 pixels in from the left and 10 from the top, and that was what you got.</p><p>With iPhone 4, Apple introduced retina screens that had double the number of pixels as previous screens. Rather than make you design all your interfaces twice, Apple automatically switched sizes from pixels to “points” – virtual pixels. On non-retina devices, a width of 10 points became 10 pixels, but on retina devices it became 20 pixels. This meant that everything looked the same size and shape on both devices, with a single layout.</p><p>Of course, the whole point of retina screens was that the screen had more pixels, so everything looked sharper – just resizing everything to be larger wasn’t enough. So, Apple took things a step further: if you create hello.png that was 200x100 in size, you could also include a file called hello@2x.png that was 400x200 in size – exactly double – and iOS would load the correct one. So, you write hello.png in your code, but iOS knows to look for and load hello@2x.png on retina devices.</p><p>Later, introduced retina HD screens that have a 3x resolution, and these follow the same naming convention: hello@2x.png is for retina devices, and hello@3x for retina HD devices. You still just write “hello” in your code and user interfaces, and iOS does the rest.</p><p>You might think this sounds awfully heavy – why should a retina device have to download apps that include Retina HD content that it can’t show? Fortunately, the App Store uses a technology called app thinning that automatically delivers only the content each device is capable of showing – it strips out the other assets when the app is being downloaded, so there’s no space wasted.</p><p>Cunningly, as of iOS 10 no non-retina devices are supported, so if you’re supporting only iOS 10 or later devices you only need to include the <code>@2x</code> and <code>@3x</code> images.</p><p>Now, all this is important because when we imported the images into our asset catalog they were automatically placed into 2x and 3x buckets. This is because I had named the files correctly: <code>france@2x.png</code>, <code>france@3x.png</code>, and so on. Xcode recognized these names, and arranged all the images correctly.</p><p>Once the images are imported, you can go ahead and use them either in code or in Interface Builder, just as you would do if they were loose files inside a content folder. So, go back to your storyboard, choose the first button and select the attributes inspector (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>). You&#39;ll see it has the title &quot;Button&quot; right now (this is in a text field directly beneath where it says &quot;Title: Plain&quot;), so please delete that text. Now click the arrow next to the Image dropdown menu and choose &quot;us&quot;.</p><p>As soon as you set a picture inside the button, our constraints for the button are complete: it has a Y position because we placed a constraint, it has an X position because we&#39;re centering it horizontally, and it has a width and a height because it&#39;s reading it from the image we assigned. Go ahead and assign the US flag to the other two buttons while you&#39;re there.</p><p>To complete our Auto Layout constraints, we need to assign Auto Layout constraints for the middle and bottom buttons. Select the middle button, then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-drag to the first button – not to the view controller. Let go, and you&#39;ll see &quot;Vertical Spacing&quot; and &quot;Center Horizontally.” Choose both of these. Now choose the third button and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-drag to the second button, and again choose &quot;Vertical Spacing&quot; and &quot;Center Horizontally.&quot;</p><p>At this point, our Auto Layout is almost complete, but you&#39;ll notice that even though we chose to center the flags horizontally, they all seem to be stuck where they were placed. The reason for this is that you need to tell Interface Builder to update all the frames of your buttons to match the Auto Layout rules you just created.</p><p>This is easy enough to do: select all three image views, then go to the Editor menu and choose <code>[Resolve Auto Layout Issues] &gt; [Update Frames]</code>. Again, you’ll see that option appears twice in the menu, but both do the same thing here so you can select either. This command will update the frames – the positions and sizes – of each image view so that it matches the Auto Layout constraints we set.</p><p>The last step before we&#39;re finished with Interface Builder for now is to add some outlets for our three flag buttons, so that we can reference them in code. Activate the assistant editor by pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> or by going to <code>[View] &gt; [Assistant Editor] &gt; [Show Assistant Editor]</code>. Now <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-drag from the first flag to your code in order to create an outlet called <code>button1</code>, then from the second flag to create <code>button2</code>, and from the third flag to create <code>button3</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/books/hws/2-10.png" alt="Create three outlets, one for each flag button." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Create three outlets, one for each flag button.</figcaption></figure>',19),Y=t("code",null,"ViewController.swift",-1),F=t("kbd",null,"Cmd",-1),M=t("kbd",null,"return",-1),K=t("h3",{id:"making-the-basic-game-work-uibutton-and-calayer",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#making-the-basic-game-work-uibutton-and-calayer"},[t("span",null,"Making the basic game work: UIButton and CALayer")])],-1),Q={class:"hint-container details"},Z=t("summary",null,"Making the basic game work: UIButton and CALayer",-1),J=t("p",null,"We're going to create an array of strings that will hold all the countries that will be used for our game, and at the same time we're going to create another property that will hold the player's current score – it's a game, after all!",-1),$=t("code",null,"@IBOutlet",-1),tt=t("code",null,"ViewController.swift",-1),et=u(`<div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">var</span> countries <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token class-name">String</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

One of the many powerful things about views in iOS is that they are backed by what&#39;s called a <code>CALayer</code>, which is a Core Animation data type responsible for managing the way your view looks.</p><p>Conceptually, <code>CALayer</code> sits beneath all your <code>UIView</code>s (that&#39;s the parent of <code>UIButton</code>, <code>UITableView</code>, and so on), so it&#39;s like an exposed underbelly giving you lots of options for modifying the appearance of views, as long as you don&#39;t mind dealing with a little more complexity. We&#39;re going to use one of these appearance options now: <code>borderWidth</code>.</p><p>The Estonian flag has a white stripe at the bottom, and because our view controller has a white background that whole stripe is invisible. We can fix that by giving the layer of our buttons a <code>borderWidth</code> of 1, which will draw a one point black line around them. Put these three lines in <code>viewDidLoad()</code> directly before it calls <code>askQuestion()</code>:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line">button1<span class="token punctuation">.</span>layer<span class="token punctuation">.</span>borderWidth <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">1</span></span>

<span class="line">button3<span class="token punctuation">.</span>layer<span class="token punctuation">.</span>borderWidth <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">1</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>Remember how points and pixels are different things? In this case, our border will be 1 pixel on non-retina devices, 2 pixels on retina devices, and 3 on retina HD devices. Thanks to the automatic point-to-pixel multiplication, this border will visually appear to have more or less the same thickness on all devices.</p><p>By default, the border of <code>CALayer</code> is black, but you can change that if you want by using the <code>UIColor</code> data type. I said that <code>CALayer</code> brings with it a little more complexity, and here&#39;s where it starts to be visible: <code>CALayer</code> sits at a lower technical level than UIButton, which means it doesn&#39;t understand what a <code>UIColor</code> is. <code>UIButton</code> knows what a <code>UIColor</code> is because they are both at the same technical level, but <code>CALayer</code> is below <code>UIButton</code>, so <code>UIColor</code> is a mystery.</p><p>Don&#39;t despair, though: <code>CALayer</code> has its own way of setting colors called <code>CGColor</code>, which comes from Apple&#39;s Core Graphics framework. This, like <code>CALayer</code>, is at a lower level than UIButton, so the two can talk happily – again, as long as you&#39;re happy with the extra complexity.</p><p>Even better, <code>UIColor</code> (which sits above <code>CGColor</code>) is able to convert to and from <code>CGColor</code> easily, which means you don&#39;t need to worry about the complexity – hurray!</p><p>So, let&#39;s put all that together into some code that changes the border color using <code>UIColor</code> and <code>CGColor</code> together. Put these three just below the three <code>borderWidth</code> lines in <code>viewDidLoad()</code>:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line">button1<span class="token punctuation">.</span>layer<span class="token punctuation">.</span>borderColor <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name">UIColor</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>lightGray<span class="token punctuation">.</span>cgColor</span>

But we can&#39;t put a <code>UIColor</code> into the <code>borderColor</code> property because it belongs to a <code>CALayer</code>, which doesn&#39;t understand what a <code>UIColor</code> is. So, we add <code>.cgColor</code> to the end of the <code>UIColor</code> to have it automagically converted to a <code>CGColor</code>. Perfect.</p><p>If <code>lightGray</code> doesn&#39;t interest you, you can create your own color like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">UIColor</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>red<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">1.0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> green<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">0.6</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> blue<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">0.2</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> alpha<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">1.0</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>cgColor</span>
