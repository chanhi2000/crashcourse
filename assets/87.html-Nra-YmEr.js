You see, users trust us with their data: our code is running on their phone, which is packed with their lifetime of photos, emails, chats, and more ‚Äì it‚Äôs a really personal device. If your app does something unexpected ‚Äì if it behaves in a way they weren‚Äôt expecting ‚Äì it‚Äôs easy to lose some trust, and once that trust is gone it‚Äôs really hard to win back.</p><p>However, small amounts of surprise in safe places releases a little dopamine rush, making users feel good about our app. iOS is filled with tiny things like this: the way the flashlight button on the home screen grows with pressure then clicks with a physical bump, the smooth zoom animations seen in the App Store, or even the page curl reading effect in Apple Books. None of those risk user data or make the app feel uncertain, they are just tiny touches that feel <em>great</em> every time you interact with them.</p><p>Core Motion opens up a whole area of delight for us, but make sure you use it judiciously: if everything moves your users will feel queasy, but if you add a tiny touch here and there it‚Äôs just one more thing to help bring your app to life.</p><p><strong>Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 26, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.</strong></p><h3 id="wrap-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wrap-up"><span>Wrap up</span></a></h3>',8),v={class:"hint-container details"},j=e("summary",null,"Wrap up",-1),x=h('<p>There&#39;s something wonderfully tactile about using the accelerometer to affect gravity in a game, because it feels incredibly realistic even though we&#39;re not using particularly good graphics.</p><p>SpriteKit is of course doing most of the hard work of collision detection, and Core Motion takes away all the complexity of working with accelerometers, so again it&#39;s our job to sew the components together to make something bigger than the sum of its parts.</p><h4 id="review-what-you-learned" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#review-what-you-learned"><span>Review what you learned</span></a></h4><p>Anyone can sit through a tutorial, but it takes actual work to remember what was taught.

This will make your code easier to read and easier to maintain, or at least it should do if you do a good job!</li><li>When the player finally makes it to the finish marker, nothing happens. What should happen? Well, that&#39;s down to <em>you</em> now. You could easily design several new levels and have them progress through.</li><li>Add a new block type, such as a teleport that moves the player from one teleport point to the other. Add a new letter type in <code>loadLevel()</code>, add another collision type to our enum, then see what you can do.</li></ol>',8),D=e("div",{class:"hint-container info"},[e("p",{class:"hint-container-title"},"Wrap up - Additional"),e("p",null,[e("a",{href:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review/hws/project-26-marble-maze",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"Review for Project 26: Marble Maze")])],-1),S=e("p",null,"That‚Äôs another fun game complete, and one with lots of expansion possibilities ‚Äì make sure you share your progress online!",-1),T=e("hr",null,null,-1);function W(p,P){const a=o("router-link"),r=o("VPCard"),c=o("VidStack");return w(),d("div",null,[e("h1",g,[e("a",y,[e("span",null,m(p.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),e("nav",k,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#project-26-part-three"},{default:i(()=>[l("Project 26, part three")]),_:1}),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#wrap-up"},{default:i(()=>[l("Wrap up")]),_:1})])])])])]),b,t(r,s(n({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 87",desc:"Project 26, part three",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/87",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),_,e("details",v,[j,t(r,s(n({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 87 - Wrap up",desc:"Wrap up",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/26/5/wrap-up",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),t(c,{src:"youtube/Y3RBwznf1WE"}),x]),D,S,T])}const A=u(f,[["render",W],["__file","87.html.vue"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"path":"/swift/100-days-of-swift/87.html","title":"Day 87","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Day 87","description":"100 Days of Swift > Day 87","category":["Swift"],"tag":["crashcourse","paul-hudson","swift","hacking-with-swift","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 87"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Day 87"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/87.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/87.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ü•ÅCrashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Day 87"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 87"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"paul-hudson"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hacking-with-swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Day 87\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Project 26, part three","slug":"project-26-part-three","link":"#project-26-part-three","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Wrap up","slug":"wrap-up","link":"#wrap-up","children":[]}]}],"git":{"createdTime":1704363136000,"updatedTime":1727918413000,"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":9}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.66,"words":798},"filePathRelative":"swift/100-days-of-swift/87.md","localizedDate":"2024ÎÖÑ 1Ïõî 4Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n\\n<hr>\\n"}');export{A as comp,V as data};
