Before we proceed to the second half of the course, I want to give you a chance to pause and take a short break. You‚Äôre still going to be learning about Swift, but in a very different format ‚Äì you‚Äôre going to be watching a video.</p><p>One of the greatest privileges given to me is the ability to travel the world and speak at iOS conferences. Not only does it give me the opportunity to hear all the other talks and meet a huge range of people, but it also forces me to pick out a topic I want to speak about, spend the time putting together my thoughts, and package it all up into a presentation I can deliver.</p><p>So, today you‚Äôre going to watch a talk I delivered at Nextdoor 2018, which was one of the conferences that took place next to Apple‚Äôs WWDC18 event. A couple of small parts of the talk are about UIKit ‚Äì <code>UIStackView</code> is the equivalent of <code>VStack</code> and <code>HStack</code>, in case you‚Äôre curious! ‚Äì but the vast majority of the talk is as useful today as it was when I first made it.</p><p>I flew out to San Jose for the week of WWDC, and half my luggage was taken up with a Jedi Knight costume. Why? Well, you‚Äôll need to watch the video!</p><p>But I also wanted to take this opportunity to let you hear a few words from someone else you might well recognize, on the importance of coding, creativity, and fun in our work.</p><p><strong>Today you have two videos to watch ‚Äì enjoy the break!</strong></p>",7),S=t("hr",null,null,-1);function D(a,I){const n=o("router-link"),i=o("VPCard"),r=o("VidStack"),s=o("VideoPlayer");return m(),l("div",null,[t("h1",w,[t("a",_,[t("span",null,h(a.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),t("nav",k,[t("ul",null,[t("li",null,[e(n,{to:"#expanding-your-horizons"},{default:p(()=>[y("Expanding your horizons")]),_:1})])])]),v,x,e(i,d(u({title:"100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 48",desc:"Expanding your horizons",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/48",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),e(r,{src:"youtube/U1gP4EcT_wQ"}),b,e(s,{src:"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1299520224-574f93c3c25a587238307c48663577947d8eb7519d7727ff5?mw=400&mh=400"}),S])}const T=c(g,[["render",D],["__file","48.html.vue"]]),U=JSON.parse('{"path":"/swift/100-days-of-swiftui/48.html","title":"Day 48","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Day 48","description":"100 Days of SwiftUI > Day 48","category":["Swift"],"tag":["crashcourse","paul-hudson","swift","swiftui","hacking-with-swift","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"100 Days of SwiftUI > Day 48"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Day 48"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swiftui/48.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swiftui/48.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ü•ÅCrashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Day 48"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"100 Days of SwiftUI > Day 48"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"paul-hudson"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swiftui"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hacking-with-swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Day 48\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Expanding your horizons","slug":"expanding-your-horizons","link":"#expanding-your-horizons","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1703642364000,"updatedTime":1727918413000,"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":8}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.43,"words":429},"filePathRelative":"swift/100-days-of-swiftui/48.md","localizedDate":"2023ÎÖÑ 12Ïõî 27Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n\\n<hr>\\n<h2>Expanding your horizons</h2>\\n"}');export{T as comp,U as data};
