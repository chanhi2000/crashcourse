Maybe <em>one</em> of them, and perhaps if I had a lot of help <em>two</em> of them, but it‚Äôs pretty unlikely.</p><p>Fortunately, I don‚Äôt need to, and neither do you: Apple‚Äôs vast collection of APIs means we too are standing on the shoulders of giants. Even things like handling dates well is a huge amount of work, but it‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt need to worry about because Apple already solved it for us.</p><p>So, seize this amazing opportunity! Build something great that combines two, three, or more frameworks and then add your own customizations on top.
