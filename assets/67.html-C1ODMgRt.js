Our code pulls out the first attachment from the first input item.</li><li>The next line uses <code>loadItem(forTypeIdentifier: )</code> to ask the item provider to actually provide us with its item, but you&#39;ll notice it uses a closure so this code executes asynchronously. That is, the method will carry on executing while the item provider is busy loading and sending us its data.</li><li>Inside our closure we first need the usual <code>[weak self]</code> to avoid strong reference cycles, but we also need to accept two parameters: the dictionary that was given to us by the item provider, and any error that occurred.</li><li>With the item successfully pulled out, we can get to the interesting stuff: working with the data. We have <code>// do stuff!</code> right now, but it&#39;ll be more interesting later, I promise.</li></ul><p>This code takes a number of shortcuts that Apple&#39;s own code doesn&#39;t, which is why it&#39;s significantly shorter.
