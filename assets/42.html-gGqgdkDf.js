I hope you can stick at it, because even if you find some things don’t “click” just yet it’s just because they take a little time to sink in.</p><p><strong>Today you have three topics to work through, and you’ll learn about <code>UICollectionView</code> and <code>UICollectionViewCell</code>.</strong></p><h3 id="setting-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#setting-up"><span>Setting up</span></a></h3>',6),I={class:"hint-container details"},_=e("summary",null,"Setting up",-1),V=o("<p>This is a fun, simple and useful project that will let you create an app to help store names of people you&#39;ve met.

But while the display is different, the underlying method calls are so similar that you could probably dive right in yourself if you wanted! (Don’t worry, though: I’ll walk you through it.)</p><p>Our collection view already has one prototype cell, which is the empty square you&#39;ll see in the top-left corner. This works the same as with table views – you&#39;ll remember we changed the initial cell in project 7 so that we could add subtitles.</p><p>Select that collection view cell now, then go to the attributes inspector: change its Background from &quot;Default&quot; (transparent) to white and give it the identifier “Person” so that we can reference it in code. Now place a <code>UIImageView</code> in there, with X:10, Y:10, width 120 and height 120. We&#39;ll be using this to show pictures of people&#39;s faces.</p><p>Place a <code>UILabel</code> in there too, with X:10, Y:134, width 120 and height 40. In the attributes inspector, change the label&#39;s font by clicking the T button and choosing &quot;Custom&quot; for font, &quot;Marker Felt&quot; for family, and &quot;Thin&quot; for style. Give it the font size 16, which is 1 smaller than the default, then set its alignment to be centered and its number of lines property to be 2.</p><figure><img src="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/books/hws/10-2.png" alt="Your collection view cell design should have one image view and one label." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Your collection view cell design should have one image view and one label.</figcaption></figure><p>So far this has been fairly usual storyboard work, but now we&#39;re going to do something we&#39;ve never done before: create a custom class for our cell. This is needed because our collection view cell has two views that we created – the image view and the label – and we need a way to manipulate this in code. The shortcut way would be to give them unique tags and give them variables when the app runs, but we&#39;re going to do it The Proper Way this time so you can learn.</p><p>Go to the File menu and choose <code>[New] &gt; [File]</code>, then select <code>[iOS] &gt; [Source] &gt; [Cocoa Touch Class]</code> and click Next. You&#39;ll be asked to fill in two text fields: where it says &quot;Subclass of&quot; you should enter &quot;UICollectionViewCell&quot;, and where it says &quot;Class&quot; enter &quot;PersonCell&quot;. Click Next then Create, and Xcode will create a new class called <code>PersonCell</code> that inherits from <code>UICollectionViewCell</code>.</p><p>This new class needs to be able to represent the collection view layout we just defined in Interface Builder, so it just needs two outlets. Give the class these two properties:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token attribute atrule">@IBOutlet</span> <span class="token keyword">var</span> imageView<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token class-name">UIImageView</span><span class="token operator">!</span></span>

Select the identity inspector (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd>) and you&#39;ll see next to Class the word &quot;UICollectionViewCell&quot; in gray text. That&#39;s telling us that the cell is its default class type.</p><p>We want to use our custom class here, so enter &quot;PersonCell&quot; and hit return. You&#39;ll see that &quot;PersonCell&quot; now appears in the document outline.</p><p>Now that Interface Builder knows that the cell is actually a <code>PersonCell</code>, we can connect its outlets. Go to the connections inspector (it&#39;s the last one, so <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>6</kbd>) with the cell selected and you&#39;ll see <code>imageView</code> and <code>name</code> in there, both with empty circles to their right. That empty circle has exactly the same meaning as when you saw it with outlets in code: there is no connection between the storyboard and code for this outlet.</p><p>To make a connection from the connections inspector, just click on the empty circle next to <code>imageView</code> and drag a line over the view you want to connect. In our case, that means dragging over the image view in our custom cell. Now connect <code>name</code> to the label, and you&#39;re done with the storyboard.</p><figure><img src="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/books/hws/10-3.png" alt="You can create and destroy Interface Builder outlets using the connections inspector." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>You can create and destroy Interface Builder outlets using the connections inspector.</figcaption></figure>`,15),R=e("h3",{id:"uicollectionview-data-sources",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#uicollectionview-data-sources"},[e("span",null,[e("code",null,"UICollectionView"),t(" data sources")])])],-1),O={class:"hint-container details"},Y=e("summary",null,"UICollectionView data sources",-1),W=o(`<p>We’ve now modified the user interface so that it considers <code>ViewController</code> to be a collection view controller, but we haven’t implemented any of the data source methods to make that work. This works just like table views, so we get questions like “how many items are there?” and “what’s in item number 1?” that we need to provide sensible answers for.</p><p>To begin with, let&#39;s put together the most basic implementation that allows our app to work. Normally this would be straightforward, but here we have a small complication: when we call <code>dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier:for:)</code> we’ll be sent back a regular <code>UICollectionViewCell</code> rather than our custom <code>PersonCell</code> type.</p><p>We can fix that we’ll add a conditional typecast, but that adds a second problem: what do we do if our typecast fails? That is, what if we expected to get a <code>PersonCell</code> but actually got back a regular <code>UICollectionViewCell</code> instead? If this happens it means something is fundamentally broken in our app – we screwed up in the storyboard, probably. As a result, we need to get out immediately; there’s no point trying to make our app limp onwards when something is really broken.</p><p>So, we’re going to be using a new function called <code>fatalError()</code>. When called this will unconditionally make your app crash – it will die immediately, and print out any message you provide to it. That might sound awful, but:</p><ol><li>You should only call this when things really are bad and you don’t want to continue – it’s really only a sense check to make sure everything is as we expect.</li><li>Swift knows that <code>fatalError()</code> always causes a crash, so we can use it to escape from a method that has a return value without sending anything back. This makes it really convenient to use in places like our current scenario.</li></ol><p>It’s best if you see <code>fatalError()</code> in some real code, so add these two methods now:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">override</span> <span class="token keyword">func</span> <span class="token function-definition function">collectionView</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token omit keyword">_</span> collectionView<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token class-name">UICollectionView</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> numberOfItemsInSection section<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token class-name">Int</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">-&gt;</span> <span class="token class-name">Int</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>

As you&#39;ll see, you can fit two cells across the screen, which is what makes the collection view different to the table view.
