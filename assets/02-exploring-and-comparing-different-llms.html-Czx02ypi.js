They are often made available by the company that created them, or by the research community. These models are allowed to be inspected, modified, and customized for the various use cases in LLMs. However, they are not always optimized for production use, and may not be as performant as proprietary models. Plus, funding for open-source models can be limited, and they may not be maintained long term or may not be updated with the latest research. Examples of popular open source models include <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpaca</a>, <a href="https://sapling.ai/llm/bloom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloom</a> and <a href="https://sapling.ai/llm/llama" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLaMA</a>.</p><p>Proprietary models are models that are owned by a company and are not made available to the public. These models are often optimized for production use. However, they are not allowed to be inspected, modified, or customized for different use cases. Plus, they are not always available for free, and may require a subscription or payment to use. Also, users do not have control over the data that is used to train the model, which means they should entrust the model owner with ensuring commitment to data privacy and responsible use of AI. Examples of popular proprietary models include <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI models</a>, <a href="https://sapling.ai/llm/bard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Bard</a> or <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude 2</a>.</p><h3 id="embedding-versus-image-generation-versus-text-and-code-generation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#embedding-versus-image-generation-versus-text-and-code-generation"><span>Embedding versus Image generation versus Text and Code generation</span></a></h3><p>LLMs can also be categorized by the output they generate.</p><p>Embeddings are a set of models that can convert text into a numerical form, called embedding, which is a numerical representation of the input text. Embeddings make it easier for machines to understand the relationships between words or sentences and can be consumed as inputs by other models, such as classification models, or clustering models that have better performance on numerical data. Embedding models are often used for transfer learning, where a model is built for a surrogate task for which there’s an abundance of data, and then the model weights (embeddings) are re-used for other downstream tasks. An example of this category is <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/embeddings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI embeddings.</a></p><figure><img src="https://microsoft.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/02-exploring-and-comparing-different-llms/images/Embedding.png" alt="Embedding" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Embedding</figcaption></figure><p>Image generation models are models that generate images.

Image generation models are often trained on large datasets of images, such as <a href="https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAION-5B</a>, and can be used to generate new images or to edit existing images with inpainting, super-resolution, and colorization techniques.

You have two colleagues; one oversees creating the content and the other oversees reviewing them.</p><p>The content creator is like a Decoder only model, they can look at the topic and see what you already wrote and then he can write a course based on that. They are very good at writing engaging and informative content, but they are not very good at understanding the topic and the learning objectives. Some examples of Decoder models are GPT family models, such as GPT-3.</p><p>The reviewer is like an Encoder only model, they look at the course written and the answers, noticing the relationship between them and understanding context, but they are not good at generating content. An example of Encoder only model would be BERT.</p><p>Imagine that we can have someone as well who could create and review the quiz, this is an Encoder-Decoder model. Some examples would be BART and T5.</p><h3 id="service-versus-model" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#service-versus-model"><span>Service versus Model</span></a></h3><p>Now, let&#39;s talk about the difference between a service and a model. A service is a product that is offered by a Cloud Service Provider, and is often a combination of models, data, and other components. A model is the core component of a service, and is often a foundation model, such as an LLM.</p><p>Services are often optimized for production use and are often easier to use than models, via a graphical user interface. However, services are not always available for free, and may require a subscription or payment to use, in exchange for leveraging the service owner’s equipment and resources, optimizing expenses and scaling easily. An example of service is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure OpenAI service</a>, which offers a pay-as-you-go rate plan, meaning users are charged proportionally to how much they use the service Also, Azure OpenAI service offers enterprise-grade security and responsible AI framework on top of the models&#39; capabilities.</p><p>Models are just the Neural Network, with the parameters, weights, and others. Allowing companies to run locally, however, would need to buy equipment, build structure to scale and buy a license or use an open-source model. A model like LLaMA is available to be used, requiring computational power to run the model.</p><hr><h2 id="how-to-test-and-iterate-with-different-models-to-understand-performance-on-azure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-test-and-iterate-with-different-models-to-understand-performance-on-azure"><span>How to test and iterate with different models to understand performance on Azure</span></a></h2><p>Once our team has explored the current LLMs landscape and identified some good candidates for their scenarios, the next step is testing them on their data and on their workload.

This means that they don’t know anything about the facts that happened after their training process, and they cannot access non-public information (like company data). This can be overcome through RAG, a technique that augments prompt with external data in the form of chunks of documents, considering prompt length limits. This is supported by Vector database tools (like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Vector Search</a>) that retrieve the useful chunks from varied pre-defined data sources and add them to the prompt Context.</p><p>This technique is very helpful when a business doesn’t have enough data, enough time, or resources to fine-tune an LLM, but still wishes to improve performance on a specific workload and reduce risks of fabrications, i.e., mystification of reality or harmful content.</p><h3 id="fine-tuned-model" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fine-tuned-model"><span>Fine-tuned model</span></a></h3><p>Fine-tuning is a process that leverages transfer learning to ‘adapt’ the model to a downstream task or to solve a specific problem. Differently from few-shot learning and RAG, it results in a new model being generated, with updated weights and biases. It requires a set of training examples consisting of a single input (the prompt) and its associated output (the completion). This would be the preferred approach if:</p><ul><li><strong>Using fine-tuned models</strong>. A business would like to use fine-tuned less capable models (like embedding models) rather than high performance models, resulting in a more cost effective and fast solution.</li><li><strong>Considering latency</strong>. Latency is important for a specific use-case, so it’s not possible to use very long prompts or the number of examples that should be learned from the model doesn’t fit with the prompt length limit.</li><li><strong>Staying up to date</strong>.
