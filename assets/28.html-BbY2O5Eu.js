As you progress with SwiftUI you‚Äôll add more and more of these jigsaw pieces, and in doing so you‚Äôll find you soon have hundreds of pieces that you can rearrange and build together to make remarkable things.</p><p>One of my favorite Steve Jobs quotes is this:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúCreativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn&#39;t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That&#39;s because they were able to connect experiences they&#39;ve had and synthesize new things.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>That‚Äôs where I want you to reach with SwiftUI ‚Äì to know that when you have a new project idea you can reach for part of project 1, part of project 3, part of project 4, and beyond, and already be 75% towards your goal. You‚Äôll get there ‚Äì just keep coming back each day!</p><p><strong>Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 4, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.</strong></p><h3 id="betterrest-wrap-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#betterrest-wrap-up"><span>BetterRest: Wrap up</span></a></h3>',8),_={class:"hint-container details"},v=e("summary",null,"BetterRest: Wrap up",-1),j=l('<p>This project gave you the chance to get some practice with forms and bindings, while also introducing you to <code>DatePicker</code>, <code>Stepper</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>DateComponents</code>, and more, while also seeing how to place buttons into the navigation bar ‚Äì these are things you‚Äôll be using time and time again, so I wanted to get them in nice and early.</p><p>Of course, I also took the chance to give you a glimpse of some of the incredible things we can build using Apple‚Äôs frameworks, all thanks to Create ML and Core ML. As you saw, these frameworks allow us to take advantage of decades of research and development in machine learning, all using a drag and drop user interface and a couple of lines of code ‚Äì it really couldn‚Äôt be any easier.</p><p>The truly fascinating thing about machine learning is that it doesn‚Äôt need big or clever scenarios to be used. You could use machine learning to predict used car prices, to figure out user handwriting, or even detect faces in images. And most importantly of all, the entire process happens on the user‚Äôs device, in complete privacy.</p><h4 id="review-what-you-learned" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#review-what-you-learned"><span>Review what you learned</span></a></h4><p>Anyone can sit through a tutorial, but it takes actual work to remember what was taught.

Do you prefer this layout or the <code>VStack</code> layout?
