Well, it’s certainly true that if we can teach computers to think competently enough it would remove the need for humans to do that thinking, but on the other hand some might argue most of humanity doesn’t do much thinking in the first place.</p><p>Still, I think you’ll be impressed by how easy it is to get started, and how it’s a really natural fit inside SwiftUI.</p><p>As a side note, I want to add that by now you’re starting to settling into the frequency of this course: some studying, some app building, a technique project, then consolidation – all repeated several times over.</p><p>However, I want to say that if at any point you’re feeling tired, or if life just gets in the way, take a break! If you come back to your code in a day or two, you’ll be more relaxed and ready to learn. Like I said at the beginning, this is a marathon not a sprint, and you won’t learn effectively if you’re stressed.</p><p><strong>Today you have five topics to work through, and you’ll meet <code>Stepper</code>, <code>DatePicker</code>, <code>DateFormatter</code>, and more.</strong></p><h3 id="betterrest-introduction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#betterrest-introduction"><span>BetterRest: Introduction</span></a></h3>',8),S={class:"hint-container details"},D=e("summary",null,"BetterRest: Introduction",-1),T=p("<p>This SwiftUI project is another forms-based app that will ask the user to enter information and convert that all into an alert, which might sound dull – you’ve done this already, right?</p><p>Well, yes, but practice is never a bad thing. However, the reason we have a fairly simple project is because I want to introduce you to one of the true power features of iOS development: machine learning (ML).</p><p>All iPhones come with a technology called Core ML built right in, which allows us to write code that makes predictions about new data based on previous data it has seen. We’ll start with some raw data, give that to our Mac as training data, then use the results to build an app able to make accurate estimates about new data – all on device, and with complete privacy for users.</p><p>The actual app we’re building is called BetterRest, and it’s designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:</p><ol><li>When do they want to wake up?</li><li>Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?</li><li>How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?</li></ol><p>Once we have those three values, we’ll feed them into Core ML to get a result telling us when they ought to go to bed. If you think about it, there are billions of possible answers – all the various wake times multiplied by all the number of sleep hours, multiplied again by the full range of coffee amounts.</p><p>That’s where machine learning comes in: using a technique called <em>regression analysis</em> we can ask the computer to come up with an algorithm able to represent all our data. This in turn allows it to apply the algorithm to fresh data it hasn’t seen before, and get accurate results.</p>",7),I={href:"https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},x=e("p",null,"Once you have those, go ahead and create a new App project in Xcode called BetterRest.

The other option is <code>Slider</code>, which we’ll be using later on – it also lets us select from a range of values, but less precisely.</p><p>Steppers are smart enough to work with any kind of number type you like, so you can bind them to <code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>, and more, and it will automatically adapt. For example, we might create a property like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token attribute atrule">@State</span> <span class="token keyword">private</span> <span class="token keyword">var</span> sleepAmount <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">8.0</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>We could then bind that to a stepper so that it showed the current value, like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">Stepper</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;</span><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">\\(</span><span class="token interpolation">sleepAmount</span><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">)</span><span class="token string"> hours&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> value<span class="token punctuation">:</span> $sleepAmount<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>When that code runs you’ll see 8.000000 hours, and you can tap the - and + to step downwards to 7, 6, 5 and into negative numbers, or step upwards to 9, 10, 11, and so on.</p><p>By default steppers are limited only by the range of their storage. We’re using a <code>Double</code> in this example, which means the maximum value of the slider will be absolutely massive.</p><p>Now, as a father of two kids I can’t tell you how much I love to sleep, but even <em>I</em> can’t sleep that much. Fortunately, <code>Stepper</code> lets us limit the values we want to accept by providing an <code>in</code> range, like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">Stepper</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;</span><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">\\(</span><span class="token interpolation">sleepAmount</span><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">)</span><span class="token string"> hours&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> value<span class="token punctuation">:</span> $sleepAmount<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">in</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">4</span><span class="token operator">...</span><span class="token number">12</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>With that change, the stepper will start at 8, then allow the user to move between 4 and 12 inclusive, but not beyond. This allows us to control the sleep range so that users can’t try to sleep for 24 hours, but it also lets us reject impossible values – you can’t sleep for -1 hours, for example.</p><p>There’s a fourth useful parameter for <code>Stepper</code>, which is a <code>step</code> value – how far to move the value each time - or + is tapped. Again, this can be any sort of number, but it does need to match the type used for the binding. So, if you are binding to an integer you can’t then use a <code>Double</code> for the step value.</p><p>In this instance, we might say that users can select any sleep value between 4 and 12, moving in 15 minute increments:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">Stepper</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;</span><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">\\(</span><span class="token interpolation">sleepAmount</span><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">)</span><span class="token string"> hours&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> value<span class="token punctuation">:</span> $sleepAmount<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">in</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">4</span><span class="token operator">...</span><span class="token number">12</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> step<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">0.25</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

First, we can use <code>displayedComponents</code> to decide what kind of options users should see:</p><ul><li>If you don’t provide this parameter, users see a day, hour, and minute.</li><li>If you use <code>.date</code> users see month, day, and year.</li><li>If you use <code>.hourAndMinute</code> users see just the hour and minute components.</li></ul><p>So, we can select a precise time like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">DatePicker</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;Please enter a time&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> selection<span class="token punctuation">:</span> $wakeUp<span class="token punctuation">,</span> displayedComponents<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>hourAndMinute<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>Finally, there’s an <code>in</code> parameter that works just the same as with <code>Stepper</code>: we can provide it with a date range, and the date picker will ensure the user can’t select beyond it.</p><p>Now, we’ve been using ranges for a while now, and you’re used to seeing things like <code>1...5</code> or <code>0..&lt;10</code>, but we can also use Swift dates with ranges.

Like, <em>really</em> hard – way harder than you think. Way harder than <em>I</em> think, and I’ve been working with dates for years.</p><p>Take a look at this trivial example:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> now <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name">Date</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>now</span>

If they did, a lot of people would be out of jobs! Think about daylight savings time: sometimes clocks go forward (losing an hour) and sometimes go backwards (gaining an hour), meaning that we might have 23 or 25 hours in those days. Then there are leap seconds: times that get added to the clocks in order to adjust for the Earth’s slowing rotation.</p><p>If you think that’s hard, try running this from your Mac’s terminal: <code>cal</code>. This prints a simple calendar for the current month, showing you the days of the week. Now try running <code>cal 9 1752</code>, which shows you the calendar for September 1752 – you’ll notice 12 whole days are missing, thanks to the calendar moving from Julian to Gregorian.</p><p>Now, the reason I’m saying all this isn’t to scare you off – dates are inevitable in our programs, after all. Instead, I want you to understand that for anything significant – any usage of dates that actually matters in our code – we should rely on Apple’s frameworks for calculations and formatting.</p><p>In the project we’re making we’ll be using dates in three ways:</p><ol><li>Choosing a sensible default “wake up” time.</li><li>Reading the hour and minute they want to wake up.</li><li>Showing their suggested bedtime neatly formatted.</li></ol><p>We could, if we wanted, do all that by hand, but then you’re into the realm of daylight savings, leap seconds, and Gregorian calendars.</p><p>Much better is to have iOS do all that hard work for us: it’s much less work, and it’s guaranteed to be correct regardless of the user’s region settings.</p><p>Let’s tackle each of those individually, starting with choosing a sensible wake up time.</p><p>As you’ve seen, Swift gives us <code>Date</code> for working with dates, and that encapsulates the year, month, date, hour, minute, second, timezone, and more. However, we don’t want to think about most of that – we want to say “give me an 8am wake up time, regardless of what day it is today.”</p><p>Swift has a slightly different type for that purpose, called <code>DateComponents</code>, which lets us read or write specific parts of a date rather than the whole thing.</p><p>So, if we wanted a date that represented 8am today, we could write code like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">var</span> components <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name">DateComponents</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line">components<span class="token punctuation">.</span>hour <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">8</span></span>
<span class="line">components<span class="token punctuation">.</span>minute <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0</span></span>
<span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> date <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name">Calendar</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>current<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">date</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>from<span class="token punctuation">:</span> components<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>Now, because of difficulties around date validation, that <code>date(from:)</code> method actually returns an optional date, so it’s a good idea to use nil coalescing to say “if that fails, just give me back the current date”, like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> date <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name">Calendar</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>current<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">date</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>from<span class="token punctuation">:</span> components<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">??</span> <span class="token class-name">Date</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>now</span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>The second challenge is how we could read the hour they want to wake up. Remember, <code>DatePicker</code> is bound to a <code>Date</code> giving us lots of information, so we need to find a way to pull out just the hour and minute components.</p><p>Again, <code>DateComponents</code> comes to the rescue: we can ask iOS to provide specific components from a date, then read those back out. One hiccup is that there’s a disconnect between the values we <em>request</em> and the values we <em>get</em> thanks to the way <code>DateComponents</code> works: we can ask for the hour and minute, but we’ll be handed back a <code>DateComponents</code> instance with optional values for all its properties. Yes, we know hour and minute will be there because those are the ones we asked for, but we still need to unwrap the optionals or provide default values.</p><p>So, we might write code like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> components <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name">Calendar</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>current<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">dateComponents</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>hour<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>minute<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> from<span class="token punctuation">:</span> someDate<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

The value we care about is called Root Mean Squared Error, and you should get a value around about 170. This means on average the model was able to predict suggested accurate sleep time with an error of only 170 seconds, or three minutes.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: Create ML provides us with both Training and Validation statistics, and both are important. When we asked it to train using our data, it automatically split the data up: some to use for training its machine learning model, but then it held back a chunk for validation. This validation data is then used to check its model: it makes a prediction based on the input, then checks how far that prediction was off the real value that came from the data.</p><p>Even better, if you go to the Output tab you’ll see an our finished model has a file size of 544 bytes or so. Create ML has taken 180KB of data, and condensed it down to just 544 bytes – almost nothing.</p><p>Now, 544 bytes sounds tiny, I know, but it’s worth adding that almost all of those bytes are metadata: the author name is in there, along with the names of all the fields: wake, estimatedSleep, coffee, and actualSleep.</p><p>The actual amount of space taken up by the hard data – how to predict the amount of required sleep based on our three variables – is well under 100 bytes. This is possible because Create ML doesn’t actually care what the values are, it only cares what the relationships are. So, it spent a couple of billion CPU cycles trying out various combinations of weights for each of the features to see which ones produce the closest value to the actual target, and once it knows the best algorithm it simply stores that.</p><p>Now that our model is trained, I’d like you to press the Get button to export it to your desktop, so we can use it in code.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you want to try training again – perhaps to experiment with the various algorithms available to us – right-click on your model source in the left-hand window, then select Duplicate.</p>",8),se=e("p",null,"Once you’ve made it through those topics, make sure and post your progress somewhere online – you’ve taken the first steps towards understanding machine learning!",-1),oe=e("hr",null,null,-1);function ie(d,le){const n=c("router-link"),s=c("VPCard"),u=c("FontIcon"),r=c("VidStack");return k(),m("div",null,[e("h1",f,[e("a",y,[e("span",null,w(d.$frontmatter.title)+" 관련",1)])]),e("nav",b,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(n,{to:"#project-4-part-1"},{default:o(()=>[a("Project 4, part 1")]),_:1}),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(n,{to:"#betterrest-introduction"},{default:o(()=>[a("BetterRest: Introduction")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(n,{to:"#entering-numbers-with-stepper"},{default:o(()=>[a("Entering numbers with Stepper")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(n,{to:"#selecting-dates-and-times-with-datepicker"},{default:o(()=>[a("Selecting dates and times with DatePicker")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(n,{to:"#working-with-dates"},{default:o(()=>[a("Working with dates")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(n,{to:"#training-a-model-with-create-ml"},{default:o(()=>[a("Training a model with Create ML")]),_:1})])])])])]),v,t(s,i(l({title:"100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 26",desc:"Project 4, part 1",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/26",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),_,e("details",S,[D,t(s,i(l({title:"100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 26 - BetterRest: Introduction",desc:"BetterRest: Introduction",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/betterrest-introduction",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),T,e("p",null,[a("You’re going to need to download some files for this project, which you can do from GitHub: "),e("a",I,[t(u,{icon:"iconfont icon-github"}),a(" twostraws/HackingWithSwift")]),a(" – make sure you look in the SwiftUI section of the files.")]),x]),j,e("details",C,[P,t(s,i(l({title:"100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 26 - Entering numbers with Stepper",desc:"Entering numbers with Stepper",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/entering-numbers-with-stepper",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),t(r,{src:"youtube/L8F6cBkOY54"}),M]),L,e("details",A,[q,t(s,i(l({title:"100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 26 - Selecting dates and times with DatePicker",desc:"Selecting dates and times with DatePicker",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/selecting-dates-and-times-with-datepicker",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),t(r,{src:"youtube/V1oL2dCwPQo"}),U]),B,e("details",R,[W,t(s,i(l({title:"100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 26 - Working with dates",desc:"Working with dates",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/working-with-dates",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),t(r,{src:"youtube/YOFqCk6HS28"}),O]),F,e("details",N,[E,t(s,i(l({title:"100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 26 - Training a model with Create ML",desc:"Training a model with Create ML",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/training-a-model-with-create-ml",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),t(r,{src:"youtube/x4XeHr_ZGsE"}),V,H,Y,$,z,K,G,e("p",null,[a("I’ve provided this data for you in "),t(u,{icon:"fas fa-file-csv"}),X,a(", which is in the project files for this project.
