With technologies like SwiftData at your side, you‚Äôre now capable of building some serious apps that interact with the user and ‚Äì most importantly ‚Äì <em>remember</em> what they entered. Although we only scratched the surface or SwiftData, it‚Äôs capable of a <em>lot</em> more and I expect Apple to keep expanding the link between SwiftData and SwiftUI in future updates. In the meantime, the very next project focuses deeply on SwiftData ‚Äì there‚Äôs lots to explore!</p><p>As for the other things you learned, you‚Äôve now even more of SwiftUI‚Äôs property wrappers, and I hope you‚Äôre getting a sense for which one to choose and when. <code>@Binding</code> is particularly useful when building custom UI components, because its ability to share data between views is just so useful.</p><p>There‚Äôs one last thing I‚Äôd like to leave you with, and it‚Äôs something you might not even have noticed. When we built a star rating component, we created something that became a user-interactive control just like <code>Button</code> and <code>Slider</code>. However, we <em>didn‚Äôt</em> stop to consider how it works with accessibility and that‚Äôs a problem: <code>Button</code>, <code>Slider</code>, and others work great of the box, but as soon as we start creating our <em>own</em> components we need to step in and do that work ourselves.</p><p>Building apps that are accessible for everyone is something everyone needs to take seriously, which is why I‚Äôve dedicated a whole technique project to it in the future ‚Äì we‚Äôre going to be looking back at the previous projects we‚Äôve made and seeing how we can improve them.</p><p>Anyway, first things first ‚Äì you have a new review and some challenges. Good luck!</p><h4 id="review-what-you-learned" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#review-what-you-learned"><span>Review what you learned</span></a></h4><p>Anyone can sit through a tutorial, but it takes actual work to remember what was taught.
