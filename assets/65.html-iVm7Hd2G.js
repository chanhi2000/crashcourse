I say “easier to follow” rather than just “easier” because it’s an important distinction – I don’t expect you’ll ever find these challenges <em>easy</em> but you will at least feel more able to tackle them. As the bike shop person said: it doesn’t get much easier, but you do get faster.</p><p><strong>Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 18, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.</strong></p><h3 id="wrap-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wrap-up"><span>Wrap up</span></a></h3>',5),j={class:"hint-container details"},D=t("summary",null,"Wrap up",-1),x=c('<p>Debugging is a unique and essential skill that’s similar but different to regular coding.
