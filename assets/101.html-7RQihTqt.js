I expect you‚Äôre feeling a number of different things right now.</p><p>I‚Äôd like to think that you‚Äôre proud of all the work you put in. Doing 100 days of coding might have sounded easy in the first week or so, but by week eight you probably had to work harder and harder to motivate yourself.</p><p>I expect you feel tired, both physically but also mentally. Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt blame you if you wanted a week or two away from Swift. Trust me: you‚Äôve earned it!</p><p>I hope you feel inspired for the future. This course was designed to expose you to a range of iOS features in a hands-on way, so you‚Äôve learned about iBeacons, multipeer connectivity, SpriteKit, Core Image, Core Motion, and more. You won‚Äôt build an app that uses <em>all</em> those things, but everyone will take different things from the course and use those experiences to build their own dream app.</p><p>However, one thing you‚Äôre almost certainly feeling is a weird sense of emptiness. For the last 100 days you‚Äôve been taking an hour or more out of your day to work on Swift ‚Äì you‚Äôve spent so long listening to my voice ramble on about UIKit selectors and similar, but now that‚Äôs all finished, so there‚Äôs a ‚Äú100 Days of Swift‚Äù-shaped hole in your life.</p><p>The natural question your brain asks is ‚Äúwhat now?‚Äù</p><p>Well, I have a few suggestions.</p><h3 id="support-free-learning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#support-free-learning"><span>Support free learning</span></a></h3><p>First, if this course was useful to you I‚Äôd like you to consider either subscribing to my tutorials or buying one of my books. I‚Äôve provided everything here ‚Äì all the daily introductions, all the videos, all the tests, and more ‚Äì free of charge, because I want to help folks reach their goals regardless of their income.</p><p>But if you enjoyed this course and want to fund my continued free work, you should consider <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subscribing to Hacking with Swift+</a> ‚Äì a tutorial service that delivers high-quality videos and articles to help you do your best with Swift.</p><p>Hacking with Swift+ even includes my massive Ultimate Portfolio App course, which walks you through building one SwiftUI app that has great architecture, testing, accessibility and more, while also using Core Data, CloudKit, Apple Pay, notifications, haptics, and more. Heck, I even show you how to port the app to macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, all so you can show off your new skills to potential employers.</p><p>Alternatively, you could buy a book from me:</p><ul><li>Pro Swift teaches you advanced Swift skills.</li><li>Swift Design Patterns teaches you advanced iOS app architecture.</li><li>[Testing Swift] teaches you how to write tests to make your code more stable.</li><li>Swift Coding Challenges gives you a range of coding problems to help you pass job interviews.</li></ul><h3 id="ship-an-app" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ship-an-app"><span>Ship an app</span></a></h3><p>It‚Äôs one thing to code an app but quite another to <em>ship</em> an app. You need to spend far more time finding and fixing bugs, testing on various devices, and of course taking screenshots, writing descriptions, and more.</p><p>So, for all the apps you‚Äôve built so far ‚Äì including all the challenges that you wrote yourself ‚Äì you‚Äôve done the first 90% of the work, but if you want <em>real</em> experience it‚Äôs time to do the second 90% of the work and actually <em>ship</em> the app.</p><h3 id="help-this-course-get-better" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#help-this-course-get-better"><span>Help this course get better</span></a></h3>',18),S=e("p",null,"You‚Äôve now finished the course, so if you‚Äôd like to tell me what you thought and how I can improve it, please do!",-1),I={href:"https://forms.gle/jKhTKfD4nW6z8poeA",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},x=e("h3",{id:"and-finally",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#and-finally"},[e("span",null,"And finally‚Ä¶")])],-1),T=e("p",null,"Throughout these 100 days I‚Äôve tried to inspire you, make you think, and perhaps even make you laugh with a range of quotes from people in our industry and beyond.",-1),C=e("p",null,"Today I‚Äôd like to sign off with some words from Ralph Waldo Emerson: ‚ÄúWhat lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you.‚Äù",-1),D=e("p",null,"I‚Äôve always said that programming is an art, and that you shouldn‚Äôt spend all your time sharpening your pencil when you should be drawing.
