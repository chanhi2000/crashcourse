So, rather than making a view disappear abruptly, can you add a transition to help the user understand something is changing?</p><p>Also, don‚Äôt forget what it looks like to be <em>playful</em> in your user interface. My all-time #1 favorite iOS animation is one that Apple ditched when they moved to iOS 7, and it was the animation for deleting passes in the Wallet app ‚Äì a metal shredder appeared and cut your pass into a dozen strips that then dropped away.

Or flip in a different direction? Experiment!</li></ol><p><strong>These challenges aren‚Äôt easy.</strong> They take only a few lines of code, but you‚Äôll need to think carefully about what modifiers you use to get the exact animations you want. Try adding an <code>@State</code> property to track which flag the user tapped on, then using that inside conditional modifiers for rotation, fading, and whatever you decide for the third challenge.</p>',11),T=t("div",{class:"hint-container info"},[t("p",{class:"hint-container-title"},"Wrap up - Additional"),t("p",null,[t("a",{href:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review/ios-swiftui/animation",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"Review for Project 6: Animation")])],-1),W=t("p",null,[a("I look forward to seeing what you create with the third challenge ‚Äì make a video and share it on Twitter, making sure to add "),t("a",{href:"https://twitter.com/twostraws",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"@twostraws"),a(" somewhere in there so I see it!")],-1),P=t("hr",null,null,-1);function C(h,R){const o=l("router-link"),i=l("VPCard");return w(),p("div",null,[t("h1",f,[t("a",y,[t("span",null,d(h.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),t("nav",g,[t("ul",null,[t("li",null,[e(o,{to:"#project-6-part-3"},{default:n(()=>[a("Project 6, part 3")]),_:1}),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,[e(o,{to:"#animation-wrap-up"},{default:n(()=>[a("Animation: Wrap up")]),_:1})])])])])]),_,e(i,r(s({title:"100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 34",desc:"Project 6, part 3",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/34",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),k,b,v,x,D,j,t("details",S,[A,e(i,r(s({title:"100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 34 - Animation: Wrap up",desc:"Animation: Wrap up",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/animation-wrap-up",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),I]),T,W,P])}const N=c(m,[["render",C],["__file","34.html.vue"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"path":"/swift/100-days-of-swiftui/34.html","title":"Day 34","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Day 34","description":"100 Days of SwiftUI > Day 34","category":["Swift"],"tag":["crashcourse","paul-hudson","swift","swiftui","hacking-with-swift","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"100 Days of SwiftUI > Day 34"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Day 34"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swiftui/34.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swiftui/34.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ü•ÅCrashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Day 34"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"100 Days of SwiftUI > Day 34"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"paul-hudson"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swiftui"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hacking-with-swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Day 34\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Project 6, part 3","slug":"project-6-part-3","link":"#project-6-part-3","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Animation: Wrap up","slug":"animation-wrap-up","link":"#animation-wrap-up","children":[]}]}],"git":{"createdTime":1703642364000,"updatedTime":1727918413000,"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":8}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.3,"words":691},"filePathRelative":"swift/100-days-of-swiftui/34.md","localizedDate":"2023ÎÖÑ 12Ïõî 27Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n\\n<hr>\\n"}');export{N as comp,O as data};
