As you know, you can create a path and draw it using two separate Core Graphics commands, but instead of running the draw command you can take the existing path and use it for clipping instead. This has the effect of only drawing things that lie inside the path, so when the <code>UIImage</code> is drawn only the parts that lie inside the elliptical clipping path are visible, thus rounding the corners.</p><p>The second new technique in this code is rendering layer shadows. iOS lets you add a basic shadow to any of its views, and it&#39;s a simple way to make something stand out on the screen. But it&#39;s not fast: it literally scans the pixels in the image to figure out what&#39;s transparent, then uses that information to draw the shadow correctly.</p><p>The combination of these two techniques creates a huge amount of work for iOS: it has to load the initial image, create a new image of the same size, render the first image into the second, the render the second image off-screen to calculate the shadow pixels, then render the whole finished product to the screen. When you hit a performance problem, you either drop the code that triggers the problem or you make it run faster.</p><p>In our case, we&#39;ll assume the designer insists the drop shadow is gorgeous so we need to make the code faster. There are several different approaches we could take, and I want to walk you through each of them so you can see the relative benefits of each.</p><p>The first possibility: Core Graphics is more than able of drawing shadows itself, which means we could handle the shadow rendering in our <code>UIGraphicsImageRenderer</code> pass rather than needing an extra render pass. To do that, we can use the Core Graphics <code>setShadow()</code> method, which takes three parameters: how far to offset the shadow, how much to blur it, and what color to use. You’ll notice there’s no way of specifying what shape the shadow should be, because Core Graphics has a simple but powerful solution: once you enable a shadow, it gets applied to everything you draw until you disable it by specifying a nil color.</p><p>So, we can replicate our current shadow like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> rounded <span class="token operator">=</span> renderer<span class="token punctuation">.</span>image <span class="token punctuation">{</span> ctx <span class="token keyword">in</span></span>

The reason for this is important, because it highlights another significant problem in the code. When the original code set the shadow size using <code>cell.imageView?.layer.shadowRadius</code> it was specified in points relative to the size of the <code>UIImageView</code>. When the new code sets the shadow size using <code>setShadow()</code> it’s in points relative to the size of the image being drawn, which is created like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> renderer <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>size<span class="token punctuation">:</span> original<span class="token punctuation">.</span>size<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>The problem is that the images being loaded are 750x750 pixels at 1x resolution, so 1500x1500 at 2x and 2250x2250 at 3x. If you look at <code>viewDidLoad()</code> you’ll see that the row height is 90 points, so we’re loading huge pictures into a tiny space. That means loading a 1500x1500 image or larger, creating a second render buffer that size, rendering the image into it, and so on.</p><p>Clearly those images don’t need to be anything like that size, but sometimes you don’t have control over it. In this app you might be able to go back to the original designer and ask them to provide smaller assets, or if you were feeling ready for a fight you could resize them yourself, but what if you had fetched these assets from a remote server? And wait until you see the size of the images in the detail view – those images might only take up 500KB on disk, but when they are uncompressed by iOS they’ll need around 45 MB of RAM!</p><p>A second thing to notice is that the result of this new shadowing isn’t quite the same, because the shadow being rendered is now properly clipped inside the bounds of its image view. Although it’s more technically correct, it doesn’t look the same, and I’m going to assume that the original look – ugly as it was – was intentional.</p><p>So, option 1 – making Core Graphics draw the shadow – helps eliminate the second render pass, but it has very different results and a result we should rule it out. However, it did at least point us to an interesting problem: we’re squeezing very large images into a tiny space. iOS doesn’t know or care that this is happening because it just does what its told, but we have more information: we know the image isn’t needed at that crazy size, so we can use that knowledge to deliver huge performance increases.</p><p>First, change the rendering code to this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> renderRect <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name">CGRect</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>origin<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>zero<span class="token punctuation">,</span> size<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token class-name">CGSize</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>width<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">90</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> height<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">90</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

Calculating the shadow is hard, because iOS doesn’t know that we clipped it to be a circle so it needs to figure out what&#39;s transparent itself. Again, though, we have more information: the shadow is going to be a perfect circle, so why bother having iOS figure out the shadow for itself?</p><p>We can tell iOS not to automatically calculate the shadow path for our images by giving it the exact shadow path to use. The easiest way to do this is to create a new <code>UIBezierPath</code> that describes our image (an ellipse with width 90 and height 90), then convert it to a <code>CGPath</code> because <code>CALayer</code> doesn&#39;t understand what <code>UIBezierPath</code> is.</p><p>Here&#39;s the updated shadow code:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token comment">// give the images a nice shadow to make them look a bit more dramatic</span></span>

This means we’ve successfully eliminated the second render pass by giving iOS the pre-calculated shadow path, and we’ve also sped up drawing by scaling down the amount of working being done. You can turn off Color Offscreen-Rendered Yellow now; we don’t need it any more.</p><p>Working with rounded corners <em>and</em> shadows can be tricky, as you’ve seen here. If it weren’t for the shadowing, we could eliminate the first render pass by setting <code>layer.cornerRadius</code> to have iOS round the corners for us – it’s a nice and easy way to create rounded rectangle shapes (or even circles!) without any custom rendering code.</p>`,24),Ie=e("h3",{id:"fixing-the-bugs-wasted-allocations",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#fixing-the-bugs-wasted-allocations"},[e("span",null,"Fixing the bugs: wasted allocations")])],-1),xe={class:"hint-container details"},Ce=e("summary",null,"Fixing the bugs: wasted allocations",-1),Te=u(`<p>Back in Xcode, press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> to launch a fresh instance of Instruments, and this time I want you to choose the Allocations instrument. This tells you how many objects you&#39;re creating and what happens to them. Press record, then scroll around the table view a few times to get a complete picture of the app running. At the very least, you should go all the way down to the bottom and back up two or three times.</p><p>What you&#39;ll see is a huge collection of information being shown – lots of &quot;malloc&quot;, lots of &quot;CFString&quot;, lots of &quot;__NSArrayM” and more. Stuff we just don&#39;t care about right now, because most of the code we have is user interface work. Fortunately, there&#39;s a search box just below the detail pane – it should say &quot;Instrument Detail&quot; but if you type &quot;UI&quot; in there it will only show information that has &quot;UI&quot; somewhere in there, which just happens to be all of Apple&#39;s user interface libraries!</p><p>In the picture below you can see how filtering for &quot;UI&quot; inside Instruments shows only data that has &quot;UI&quot; in its name somewhere, which primarily restricts the view to things that come from Apple&#39;s UIKit libraries.</p><figure><img src="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/books/hws/30-2.png" alt="Use Instruments&#39;s filtering system to show only items that matter to you." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Use Instruments&#39;s filtering system to show only items that matter to you.</figcaption></figure><p>Once you filter by &quot;UI&quot; you&#39;ll see see <code>UIImage</code>, <code>UIImageView</code>, <code>UITableViewCell</code> and more. The allocations instrument will tell you how many of these objects are persistent (created and still exist) and how many are transient (created and since destroyed). Notice how just swiping around has created a large number of transient <code>UIImageView</code> and <code>UITableViewCell</code> objects?</p><p>This is happening because each time the app needs to show a cell, it creates it then creates all the subviews inside it – namely an image view and a label, plus some hidden views we don’t usually care about. iOS works around this cost by using the method <code>dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier:)</code>, but if you look at the <code>cellForRowAt</code> method you won’t find it there. This means iOS is forced to create a new cell from scratch, rather than re-using an existing cell. This is a common coding mistake to make when you&#39;re not using storyboards and prototype cells, and it&#39;s guaranteed to put a speed bump in your apps.</p><p>If you look inside <code>cellForRowAt</code> method you&#39;ll see this line:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> cell <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name">UITableViewCell</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>style<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">default</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> reuseIdentifier<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;Cell&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>That&#39;s the only place where table view cells are being created, so clearly it&#39;s the culprit because it creates a new cell every time the table view asks for one. This has been slow since the very first days of iOS development, and Apple has always had a solution: ask the table view to dequeue a cell, and if you get <code>nil</code> back then create a cell yourself.</p><p>This is different from when we were using prototype cells with a storyboard. With storyboards, if you dequeue a prototype cell then iOS automatically handles creating them as needed.</p><p>If you&#39;re creating table view cells in code, you have two options to fix this intense allocation of views. First, you could rewrite the above line to be this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">var</span> cell<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token class-name">UITableViewCell</span><span class="token operator">!</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> tableView<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">dequeueReusableCell</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>withIdentifier<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;Cell&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="token keyword">if</span> cell <span class="token operator">==</span> <span class="token nil constant">nil</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>
<span class="line">    cell <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token class-name">UITableViewCell</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>style<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">default</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> reuseIdentifier<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;Cell&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span class="token punctuation">}</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>That dequeues a cell, but if it gets <code>nil</code> back then we create one. Note the force unwrapped optional at the end of the first line – we’re saying that <code>cell</code> might initially be empty, but it will definitely have a value by the time it’s used.</p><p>The other solution you could use is to register a class with the table view for the reuse identifier &quot;Cell&quot;. Using this method you would add this to <code>viewDidLoad()</code>:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line">tableView<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">register</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">UITableViewCell</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">self</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> forCellReuseIdentifier<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;Cell&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>And now we can use our usual method dequeuing table view cells inside <code>cellForRowAt</code>:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> cell <span class="token operator">=</span> tableView<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">dequeueReusableCell</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>withIdentifier<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;Cell&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">for</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> indexPath<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>With this approach, you will never get <code>nil</code> when dequeuing a cell with the identifier &quot;Cell&quot;. As with prototype cells, if there isn&#39;t one to dequeue a new cell will be created automatically.</p><p>The second solution is substantially newer than the first and can really help cut down the amount of code you need. But it has two drawbacks: with the first solution you can specify different kinds of cell styles than just <code>.default</code>, not least the <code>.subtitle</code> option we used in project 7; also, with the first solution you explicitly know when a cell has just been created, so it&#39;s easy to force any one-off work into the <code>if cell == nil {</code> block.</p><p>Regardless of which solution you chose (you&#39;ll use both in your production code, I expect), you should be able to run the allocations instrument again and see far fewer table view cell allocations. With this small change, iOS will just reuse cells as they are needed, which makes your code run faster and operate more efficiently.</p>`,20),Se=e("hr",null,null,-1);function qe(d,ze){const t=r("router-link"),o=r("VPCard"),p=r("VidStack"),a=r("FontIcon");return m(),w("div",null,[e("h1",f,[e("a",b,[e("span",null,g(d.$frontmatter.title)+" 관련",1)])]),e("nav",y,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[s(t,{to:"#project-30-part-one"},{default:i(()=>[n("Project 30, part one")]),_:1}),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[s(t,{to:"#setting-up"},{default:i(()=>[n("Setting up")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[s(t,{to:"#what-are-we-working-with"},{default:i(()=>[n("What are we working with?")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[s(t,{to:"#what-can-instruments-tell-us"},{default:i(()=>[n("What can Instruments tell us?")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[s(t,{to:"#fixing-the-bugs-slow-shadows"},{default:i(()=>[n("Fixing the bugs: slow shadows")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[s(t,{to:"#fixing-the-bugs-wasted-allocations"},{default:i(()=>[n("Fixing the bugs: wasted allocations")]),_:1})])])])])]),v,s(o,l(c({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 97",desc:"Project 30, part one",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/97",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgb(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),_,I,x,C,T,S,q,e("details",z,[j,s(o,l(c({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 97 - Setting up",desc:"Setting up",link:"https://hackingwithswift.com/read/30/1/setting-up",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgb(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),s(p,{src:"youtube/RIiyITB0sQM"}),R,W,O,e("p",null,[n("You should download the source code for this project from "),e("a",P,[s(a,{icon:"iconfont icon-github"}),U]),n(" then modify it as we go.
