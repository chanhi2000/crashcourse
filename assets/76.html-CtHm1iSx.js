Almost any physical location ‚Äì from an office to a warehouse to a school to a museum ‚Äì can benefit from triggering behaviors on the user‚Äôs device as they move around, so the real question is: what are you going to do with this technology?</p><p>Mo Farah ‚Äì multiple-time British Olympic gold medallist ‚Äì said ‚Äúif you dream and have the ambition and want to work hard, then you can achieve.‚Äù Today is day 76 so you can clearly work hard, and I hope I‚Äôve planted the dream of something big in your head ‚Äì all that remains is your ambition to bring about that goal based on what you know.</p><p>And before you start doubting yourself, think about it: at this point you already know large parts of UIKit and SpriteKit, you can fetch and parse data from the internet using <code>Codable</code>, you can mark locations on maps, read from the camera, create animations, and more ‚Äì the range of apps you can build is <em>huge</em> if you put your mind to it.</p><p><strong>Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 22, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.</strong></p><h3 id="wrap-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wrap-up"><span>Wrap up</span></a></h3>',6),v={class:"hint-container details"},D=e("summary",null,"Wrap up",-1),j=h('<p>Working with iBeacon locations is different from working with maps. The technology is often called <em>micro-location</em> because it can tell the difference between a few centimeters and a meter or more.

Make sure you set a Boolean to say the alert has been shown, so it doesn‚Äôt keep appearing.</li><li>Go through two or three other iBeacons in the Detect Beacon app and add their UUIDs to your app, then register all of them with iOS. Now add a second label to the app that shows new text depending on which beacon was located.</li><li>Add a circle to your view, then use animation to scale it up and down depending on the distance from the beacon ‚Äì try 0.001 for unknown, 0.25 for far, 0.5 for near, and 1.0 for immediate. You can make the circle by adding an image, or by creating a view that‚Äôs 256 wide by 256 high then setting its <code>layer.cornerRadius</code> to 128 so that it‚Äôs round.</li></ol>',8),x=e("div",{class:"hint-container info"},[e("p",{class:"hint-container-title"},"Wrap up - Additional"),e("p",null,[e("a",{href:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review/hws/project-22-detect-a-beacon",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"Review for Project 22: Detect-a-Beacon")])],-1),S=e("p",null,"That‚Äôs another project finished, and one that opens a whole new world of micro-location possibilities ‚Äì share your progress with the world!",-1),P=e("hr",null,null,-1);function T(l,B){const a=o("router-link"),r=o("VPCard"),p=o("VidStack");return m(),u("div",null,[e("h1",y,[e("a",g,[e("span",null,w(l.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),e("nav",b,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#project-22-part-two"},{default:n(()=>[c("Project 22, part two")]),_:1}),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#wrap-up"},{default:n(()=>[c("Wrap up")]),_:1})])])])])]),k,t(r,i(s({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 76",desc:"Project 22, part two",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/76",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),_,e("details",v,[D,t(r,i(s({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 76 - Wrap up",desc:"Wrap up",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/22/4/wrap-up",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),t(p,{src:"youtube/RJXC2wv8vQQ"}),j]),x,S,P])}const R=d(f,[["render",T],["__file","76.html.vue"]]),I=JSON.parse('{"path":"/swift/100-days-of-swift/76.html","title":"Day 76","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Day 76","description":"100 Days of Swift > Day 76","category":["Swift"],"tag":["crashcourse","paul-hudson","swift","hacking-with-swift","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 76"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Day 76"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/76.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/76.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ü•ÅCrashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Day 76"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 76"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"paul-hudson"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hacking-with-swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Day 76\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Project 22, part two","slug":"project-22-part-two","link":"#project-22-part-two","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Wrap up","slug":"wrap-up","link":"#wrap-up","children":[]}]}],"git":{"createdTime":1703642364000,"updatedTime":1727918413000,"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":11}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.43,"words":728},"filePathRelative":"swift/100-days-of-swift/76.md","localizedDate":"2023ÎÖÑ 12Ïõî 27Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n\\n<hr>\\n"}');export{R as comp,I as data};
