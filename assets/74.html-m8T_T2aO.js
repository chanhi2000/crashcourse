This is a measure of how well our app can be used by people with varying access needs – they might need larger text, they might need us to avoid certain colors to help them see things clearly, they might need our UI to be read out, and so on.</p><p>Too many developers completely ignore the importance of accessibility, which results in apps that are completely opaque to large numbers of people. Tony Fadell – the creator of the iPod at Apple – had this to say: “you are defined by what you do and also by what you don’t do.”</p><p>Sure, you can skip accessibility and 90% of people won’t notice, but do you want to be defined by that? I’d wager that the answer is <em>no</em>.</p><p><strong>Today you have four topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about accessibility labels, values, hints, and more.</strong></p><h3 id="accessibility-introduction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#accessibility-introduction"><span>Accessibility: Introduction</span></a></h3>',6),_={class:"hint-container details"},V=s("summary",null,"Accessibility: Introduction",-1),I=c("<p>Making your app accessible means taking steps to ensure that everyone can use it fully regardless of their individual needs. For example, if they are blind then your app should work well with the system’s VoiceOver system to ensure your UI can be read smoothly.</p><p>SwiftUI gives us a huge amount of functionality for free, because its layout system of <code>VStack</code> and <code>HStack</code> naturally forms a flow of views. However, it isn’t perfect, and any time you can add some extra information to help out the iOS accessibility system it’s likely to help.</p><p>Usually the best way to test out your app is to enable VoiceOver support and run the app on a real device – if your app works great with VoiceOver, there’s a good chance you’re already far ahead of the average for iOS apps.</p><p>Anyway, in this technique project we’re going to look at a handful of accessibility techniques, then look at some of the previous projects we made to see how they might get upgraded.</p><p>For now, please create a new iOS app using the App template.

Alternatively, you can activate Siri at any time and ask to enable or disable VoiceOver.</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: Immediately below the VoiceOver toggle is instructions for how to use it. The regular taps and swipes you’re used to no longer function the same way, so read those instructions!</p><p>Now launch our app on your device, and try tapping once on the picture to activate it. If you listen carefully to VoiceOver you should hear two problems:</p><ol><li>Reading out “Kevin Horstmann one four one seven zero five” is not only unhelpful for the user because it doesn’t describe the picture at all, but it’s actually confusing – the long string of numbers does more harm than good.</li><li>After reading the above string, VoiceOver then says “image”. This is true, it <em>is</em> an image, but it’s also acting as a button because we added an <code>onTapGesture()</code> modifier.</li></ol><p>The first of those problems is a side effect of SwiftUI trying to give us sensible behavior out of the box: when given an image, it automatically uses the image’s filename as the text to read out.</p><p>We can control what VoiceOver reads for a given view by attaching two modifiers: <code>.accessibilityLabel()</code> and <code>.accessibilityHint()</code>. They both take text containing anything we want, but they serve different purposes:</p><ul><li>The <em>label</em> is read immediately, and should be a short piece of text that gets right to the point. If this view deletes an item from the user’s data, it might say “Delete”.</li><li>The <em>hint</em> is read after a short delay, and should provide more details on what the view is there for. It might say “Deletes an email from your inbox”, for example.</li></ul><p>The label is exactly what we need to solve the first of our problems, because it means we can leave the image name as it is while still having VoiceOver read out something that helps users.</p><p>First, add this second array of image descriptions as a property for <code>ContentView</code>:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> labels <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span></span>

Of course, if your image wasn’t randomly changing you could just type your label directly into the modifier.</p><p>The second problem is that the image is identified as an image. This is self-evidently true, but it’s also not helpful because we’ve attached a tap gesture to it so it’s effectively a button.</p><p>We can fix this second problem using another modifier, <code>.accessibilityAddTraits()</code>. This lets us provide some extra behind the scenes information to VoiceOver that describes how the view works, and in our case we can tell it that our image is also a button by adding this modifier:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">accessibilityAddTraits</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>isButton<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

There are three in particular I want to focus on:</p><ul><li>Marking images as being unimportant for VoiceOver.</li><li>Hiding views from the accessibility system.</li><li>Grouping several views as one.</li></ul><p>All of these are simple changes to make, but they result in a big improvement.</p><p>For example, we can tell SwiftUI that a particular image is just there to make the UI look better by using <code>Image(decorative:)</code>. Whether it’s a simple bullet point or an animation of your app’s mascot character running around, it doesn’t actually convey any information and so <code>Image(decorative:)</code> tells SwiftUI it should be ignored by VoiceOver.</p><p>Use it like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">Image</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>decorative<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;character&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>This leaves the image as being accessible to VoiceOver if it has some important traits, such as <code>.isButton</code> – it will say “button” when it’s highlighted, and if we attach a tap gesture that works – but it <em>doesn’t</em> read out the image’s filename as the automatic VoiceOver label. If you then add a label or a hint that <em>will</em> be read.</p><p>If you want to go a step further, you can use the <code>.accessibilityHidden()</code> modifier, which makes any view completely invisible to the accessibility system:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">Image</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>decorative<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;character&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>With that modifier the image becomes invisible to VoiceOver regardless of what traits it has. Obviously you should only use this if the view in question really does add nothing – if you had placed a view offscreen so that it wasn’t currently visible to users, you should mark it inaccessible to VoiceOver too.</p><p>The last way to hide content from VoiceOver is through <em>grouping</em>, which lets us control how the system reads several views that are related. As an example, consider this layout:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">VStack</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>
<span class="line">    <span class="token class-name">Text</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;Your score is&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line">    <span class="token class-name">Text</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;1000&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line">        <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">font</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>title<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span class="token punctuation">}</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>VoiceOver sees that as two unrelated text views, and so it will either read “Your score is” or “1000” depending on what the user has selected. Both of those are unhelpful, which is where the <code>.accessibilityElement(children:)</code> modifier comes in: we can apply it to a parent view, and ask it to combine children into a single accessibility element.</p><p>For example, this will cause both text views to be read together:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">VStack</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>

So, the better solution here is to use <code>.accessibilityElement(children: .ignore)</code> so the child views are invisible to VoiceOver, then provide a custom label to the parent, like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token class-name">VStack</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>

Using <code>.combine</code> adds a pause between the two pieces of text, because they aren’t necessarily designed to be read together. Using <code>.ignore</code> and a custom label means the text is read all at once, and is much more natural.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: <code>.ignore</code> is the default parameter for <code>children</code>, so you can get the same results as <code>.accessibilityElement(children: .ignore)</code> just by saying <code>.accessibilityElement()</code>.</p>`,21),U=s("h3",{id:"reading-the-value-of-controls",tabindex:"-1"},[s("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#reading-the-value-of-controls"},[s("span",null,"Reading the value of controls")])],-1),H={class:"hint-container details"},P=s("summary",null,"Reading the value of controls",-1),R=c(`<p>By default SwiftUI provides VoiceOver readouts for its user interface controls, and although these are often good sometimes they just don’t fit with what you need.
