How you ask for permission depends on what you&#39;re trying to do: would you like the user&#39;s location only when your app is running, or would you like a user&#39;s location even when your app isn&#39;t running?</p><p>You might think that you&#39;d only ever want location access when your app is running. After all, what&#39;s the point in asking for information when your app isn&#39;t around to use it?</p><p>There are times you&#39;ll want both. For example, if you&#39;re creating a map app that shows users how to get from their current location to your nearest store, you&#39;ll only need their location when the app is being used. But if you&#39;re creating an app that needs to be woken up when the user reaches a location, then you&#39;ll need access even when the app isn&#39;t running – iOS monitors the user&#39;s location on your behalf and automatically starts your app as needed.</p><p>Using location when the app isn’t running is of course highly sensitive information, so Apple flags it up in three ways:</p><ol><li>If you request Always access, users will still get the chance to choose When In Use.</li><li>If they choose Always, iOS will automatically ask them again after a few days to confirm they still want to grant Always access.</li><li>When your app is using location data in the background the iOS UI will update to reflect that – users will know it’s happening.</li><li>Users can, at any point, go into the settings app and change from Always down to When In Use.</li></ol><p>In this app we’re going to request Always access so that our app can detect beacons in the background. Requesting location access requires a change to your apps Info.plist file, which is the property list file we first met way back in project 3. We need to add to that file the reason why we want the user’s location – a string that will be shown in the iOS UI when the user is being asked to accept or decline our request.</p><p>Because of the rules above, we need to add two keys: “Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Description” and “Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description”. So, please add them both now, make sure their types are set to String, then in the value fields enter some text to explain to users <em>why</em> you want their location. For example, &quot;We want to help you find your nearest store.&quot; When your user is prompted to grant location access, this text will be shown alongside Apple&#39;s own descriptive message.</p><figure><img src="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/img/books/hws/22-1.png" alt="When iOS requests location access users are likely to be suspicious, so make sure you explain why you want it." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>When iOS requests location access users are likely to be suspicious, so make sure you explain why you want it.</figcaption></figure>',8),B=n("code",null,"Main.storyboard",-1),T=n("code",null,"distanceReading",-1),D=n("p",null,`That label will show one of four messages depending on how close we are to our test beacon, which of course might be an iPad acting as a beacon if you don't own actual hardware.

First, we use a new class called <code>CLBeaconRegion</code>, which is used to identify a beacon uniquely. Second, we give that to our <code>CLLocationManager</code> object by calling its <code>startMonitoring(for:)</code> and <code>startRangingBeacons(in:)</code> methods. Once that&#39;s done, we sit and wait. As soon as iOS has anything tell us, it will do so.</p><p>iBeacons are identified using three pieces of information: a universally unique identifier (UUID), plus a major number and a minor number. The first number is a long hexadecimal string that you can create by running the <code>uuidgen</code> in your Mac&#39;s terminal. It should identify you or your store chain uniquely.</p><p>The major number is used to subdivide within the UUID. So, if you have 10,000 stores in your supermarket chain, you would use the same UUID for them all but give each one a different major number. That major number must be between 1 and 65535, which is enough to identify every McDonalds and Starbucks outlet combined!</p><p>The minor number can (if you wish) be used to subdivide within the major number. For example, if your flagship London store has 12 floors each of which has 10 departments, you would assign each of them a different minor number.</p><p>The combination of all three identify the user&#39;s precise location:</p><ul><li><strong>UUID</strong>: You&#39;re in a Acme Hardware Supplies store.</li><li><strong>Major</strong>: You&#39;re in the Glasgow branch.</li><li><strong>Minor</strong>: You&#39;re in the shoe department on the third floor.</li></ul><p>If you don&#39;t need that level of detail you can skip minor or even major – it&#39;s down to you.</p><p>It&#39;s time to put this into code, so we&#39;re going to create a new method called <code>startScanning()</code> that contains the following:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">func</span> <span class="token function-definition function">startScanning</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>

However, Swift should show you a warning because Apple has marked <code>CLProximity</code> as an enum that might change in the future – they might add more fine-grained values, for example.</p><p>This is only a <em>warning</em> rather than an <em>error</em> because you can build ship your code without covering future cases if you want to. However, if you do that you risk running into problems in the future: if Apple added an extra <code>.farFarAway</code> case in there, what would your code do?</p><p>There are two solutions here: we can add a special case called <code>@unknown default</code>, which is specifically there to catch future values.
