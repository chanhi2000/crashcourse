You might not realize it yet, but you have enough knowledge now to make a huge range of apps!</p><p>Before we finish, you may have spotted one problem with this app: if you quit the app and relaunch, it hasn&#39;t remembered the people you added. Worse, the JPEGs are still stored on the disk, so your app takes up more and more room without having anything to show for it!</p><p>This is quite intentional, and something we&#39;ll return to fix in project 12.

This is only available on devices (<em>not on the simulator</em>) so you might want to check the return value of <code>UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable()</code> before trying to use it!</li><li>Modify project 1 so that it uses a collection view controller rather than a table view controller.
