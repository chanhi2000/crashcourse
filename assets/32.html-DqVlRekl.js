That might be a small snippet you’ve generated yourself, or it might be a complete website as seen in project 4.</p><p>After that, project 5 showed you how to build your second game, while also sneaking in a little more practice with <code>UITableViewController</code>. Starting from project 11 we’ll be switching to SpriteKit for games, but there are lots of games you can make in UIKit too.</p><p>WebKit is the second external framework we’ve used, after the Social framework in project 3. These frameworks always deliver lots of complex functionality grouped together for one purpose, but you also learned lots of other things too:</p><ul><li>Delegation. We used this in project 4 so that WebKit events get sent to our <code>ViewController</code> class so that we can act on them.</li><li>We used <code>UIAlertController</code> with its <code>.actionSheet</code> style to present the user with options to choose from. We gave it a <code>.cancel</code> button without a handler, which dismisses the options.</li><li>You saw you can place <code>UIBarButtonItems</code> into the <code>toolbarItems</code> property, then have a <code>UIToolbar</code> shown by the navigation controller. We also used the <code>.flexibleSpace</code> button type to make the layout look better.</li><li>You met Key-Value Observing, or KVO, which we used to update the loading progress in our web browser. This lets you monitor any property in all of iOS and be notified when it changes.</li><li>You learned how to load text files from disk using <code>contentsOf</code>.</li><li>We added a text field to <code>UIAlertController</code> for the first time, then read it back using <code>ac?.textFields?[0]</code>. We’ll be doing this in several other projects in this series.</li><li>You dipped your toes into the world of closures once again. These are complicated beasts when you’re learning, but at this point in your Swift career just think of them as functions you can pass around in variables or as parameters to other functions.</li><li>You worked with some methods for string and array manipulation: <code>contains()</code>, <code>remove(at:)</code>, <code>firstIndex(of:)</code>.</li></ul><p>On top of that, we also took a deep-dive into the world of Auto Layout. We used this briefly in projects 1 and 2, but you’ve now learned more ways to organize your designs: Visual Format Language and anchors. There are other ways yet to come, and soon you’ll start to find you prefer one method over another – and that’s OK.

However, it’s common to write part or all of your user interface in code, and for those times you’re likely to want to replace <code>loadView()</code> with your own implementation.</p><p>If you wanted a more complex layout – perhaps if you wanted the web view to occupy only part of the screen – then this approach wouldn’t have worked. Instead, you would need to load the normal storyboard view then use <code>viewDidLoad()</code> to place the web view where you wanted it.</p><p>As well as overriding the <code>loadView()</code> method, project 4 also had a <code>webView</code> property. This was important, because as far as Swift is concerned the regular <code>view</code> property is just a <code>UIView</code>.</p><p>Yes, <em>we</em> know it’s actually a <code>WKWebView</code>, but Swift doesn’t. So, when you want to call any methods on it like reload the page, Swift won’t let you say <code>view.reload()</code> because as far as it’s concerned <code>UIView</code> doesn’t have a <code>reload()</code> method.</p><p>That’s what the property solves: it’s like a permanent typecast for the <code>view</code>, so that whenever we need to manipulate the web view we can use that property and Swift will let us.</p><p>The second interesting piece of code is this, taken from project 5:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token keyword">let</span> startWords <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">try</span><span class="token operator">?</span> <span class="token class-name">String</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>contentsOf<span class="token punctuation">:</span> startWordsURL<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>

The <code>contentsOf</code> initializer for strings lets you load some text from disk. If it succeeds you’ll get the text back, but if it fails Swift will complain loudly by throwing an exception.</p><p>You learned about <code>try</code>, <code>try!</code>, and <code>try?</code> some time ago, but I hope now you can see why it’s helpful to have all three around. What <code>try?</code> does is say, “instead of throwing an exception, just return nil if the operation failed.” And so, rather than <code>contentsOf</code> returning a <code>String</code> it will actually return a <code>String?</code> – it might be some text, or it might be nil. That’s where <code>if let</code> comes in: it checks the return value from <code>contentsOf</code> and, if it finds valid text, executes the code inside the braces.</p><p>The last piece of code I’d like to review is this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift" data-title="swift"><pre><code><span class="line">view<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">addConstraints</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">NSLayoutConstraint</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">constraints</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>withVisualFormat<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;V:|[label1(labelHeight)]-[label2(labelHeight)]-[label3(labelHeight)]-[label4(labelHeight)]-[label5(labelHeight)]-&gt;=10-|&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> options<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> metrics<span class="token punctuation">:</span> metrics<span class="token punctuation">,</span> views<span class="token punctuation">:</span> viewsDictionary<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

You need to read it very carefully, sometimes jumping back and forward, in order to unpick what it’s trying to do. VFL is the quickest and easiest way to solve many Auto Layout problems in an expressive way, but as you progress through this course you’ll learn alternatives such as <code>UIStackView</code> that can do the same thing without the complex syntax.</p>`,16),U=e("h3",{id:"challenge",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#challenge"},[e("span",null,"Challenge")])],-1),L={class:"hint-container details"},O=e("summary",null,"Challenge",-1),Y=r(`<p>It’s time to put your skills to the test by making your own complete app from scratch. This time your job is to create an app that lets people create a shopping list by adding items to a table view.</p><p>The best way to tackle this app is to think about how you build project 5: it was a table view that showed items from an array, and we used a <code>UIAlertController</code> with a text field to let users enter free text that got appended to the array. That forms the foundation of this app, except this time you don’t need to validate items that get added – if users enter some text, assume it’s a real product and add it to their list.</p><p>For bonus points, add a left bar button item that clears the shopping list – what method should be used afterwards to make the table view reload all its data?</p><p>Here are some hints in case you hit problems:</p><ul><li>Remember to change <code>ViewController</code> to build on <code>UITableViewController</code>, then change the storyboard to match.</li><li>Create a <code>shoppingList</code> property of type <code>[String]</code> to hold all the items the user wants to buy.</li><li>Create your <code>UIAlertController</code> with the style <code>.alert</code>, then call <code>addTextField()</code> to let the user enter text.</li><li>When you have a new shopping list item, make sure you <code>insert()</code> it into your <code>shoppingList</code> array before you call the <code>insertRows(at:)</code> method of your table view – your app will crash if you do this the wrong way around.</li></ul><p>You might be tempted to try to use <code>UIActivityViewController</code> to share the finished shopping list by email, but if you do that you’ll hit a problem: you have an array of strings, not a single string.</p><p>There’s a special method that can create one string from an array, by stitching each part together using a separator you provide.
