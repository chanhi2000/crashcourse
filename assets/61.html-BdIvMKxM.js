Once that‚Äôs done, change the <code>pinTintColor</code> property to your favorite <code>UIColor</code>.</li><li>Add a <code>UIAlertController</code> that lets users specify how they want to view the map. There&#39;s a <code>mapType</code> property that draws the maps in different ways. For example, <code>.satellite</code> gives a satellite view of the terrain.</li><li>Modify the callout button so that pressing it shows a new view controller with a web view, taking users to the Wikipedia entry for that city.</li></ol>',8),D=e("div",{class:"hint-container info"},[e("p",{class:"hint-container-title"},"Wrap up - Additional"),e("p",null,[e("a",{href:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review/hws/project-16-capital-cities",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"Review for Project 16: Capital Cities")])],-1),C=e("p",null,"That‚Äôs another project finished, and one that gets you started with one of the most popular and powerful iOS frameworks ‚Äì make sure you share your progress with others once you complete the challenges!",-1),T=e("hr",null,null,-1);function S(p,P){const a=o("router-link"),r=o("VPCard"),h=o("VidStack");return m(),w("div",null,[e("h1",g,[e("a",y,[e("span",null,u(p.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),e("nav",k,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#project-16-part-two"},{default:n(()=>[c("Project 16, part two")]),_:1}),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(a,{to:"#wrap-up"},{default:n(()=>[c("Wrap up")]),_:1})])])])])]),_,t(r,i(s({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 61",desc:"Project 16, part two",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/61",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),b,e("details",v,[j,t(r,i(s({title:"100 Days of Swift - Day 61 - Wrap up",desc:"Wrap up",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/16/4/wrap-up",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(213,52,58,0.2)"})),null,16),t(h,{src:"youtube/P-2RCqOhNmc"}),x]),D,C,T])}const V=d(f,[["render",S],["__file","61.html.vue"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"path":"/swift/100-days-of-swift/61.html","title":"Day 61","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Day 61","description":"100 Days of Swift > Day 61","category":["Swift"],"tag":["crashcourse","paul-hudson","swift","hacking-with-swift","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 61"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Day 61"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/61.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swift/61.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ü•ÅCrashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Day 61"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"100 Days of Swift > Day 61"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"paul-hudson"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hacking-with-swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Day 61\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Project 16, part two","slug":"project-16-part-two","link":"#project-16-part-two","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Wrap up","slug":"wrap-up","link":"#wrap-up","children":[]}]}],"git":{"createdTime":1703642364000,"updatedTime":1727918413000,"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":10}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.19,"words":658},"filePathRelative":"swift/100-days-of-swift/61.md","localizedDate":"2023ÎÖÑ 12Ïõî 27Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n\\n<hr>\\n"}');export{V as comp,K as data};
