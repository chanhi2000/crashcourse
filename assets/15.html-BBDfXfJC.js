You made it through all the fundamentals of the Swift programming language. Each day was purposefully very short to give you a solid introduction to the topic, but today is different because we‚Äôre going to be reviewing almost everything you learned so far.</p><p><strong>I know what you‚Äôre thinking.</strong> You‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúwhy bother? I already learned this stuff ‚Äì why go over it again?‚Äù</p><p>Well, there are several reasons:</p><ul><li>Repetition helps us learn things more thoroughly. These fundamentals are really important in all the Swift you‚Äôll write, so it‚Äôs worth doubling down to make sure you understand them fully.</li><li>Some concepts only make complete sense when you‚Äôve understood other concepts. Circling back like this will help link together the core Swift concepts in your head.</li><li>You might have missed something. Let‚Äôs face it, you‚Äôve just gone through a ton of videos about the most important parts of Swift ‚Äì are you absolutely sure you remembered all of it?</li><li>You‚Äôll see how far you‚Äôve come. When you read about arrays and loops ‚Äì things you might have found challenging previously ‚Äì hopefully you‚Äôll find them easier now, and feel good that you‚Äôre making progress.</li></ul><p>And if you <em>do</em> find today easy, that‚Äôs okay ‚Äì immediately afterwards we‚Äôll be starting the SwiftUI projects at which point the difficulty level ramps up. Enjoy the quiet while it lasts!</p><p><strong>Today you have just one tutorial to follow, although it‚Äôs pretty darn packed.</strong> This tutorial recaps almost every topic we‚Äôve covered so far using precise code samples from the various days, and is available either as an hour-long video or one long text article.</p><ul><li>Here‚Äôs the tutorial you need to follow today: <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/242/learn-essential-swift-in-one-hour" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn essential Swift in one hour</a>.</li></ul><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">Optional</p><p>once you‚Äôve finished reviewing that article, you can go back to the <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review page</a> and go over any tests related to the topics above that you want ‚Äì it‚Äôs your choice/</p></div><h3 id="bonus-find-the-swifty-words" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bonus-find-the-swifty-words"><span>Bonus: find the Swifty words!</span></a></h3><p>I‚Äôve made a word search to help you test your knowledge of the most useful terms for Swift developers.
