This is sometimes called ‚Äúscope creep‚Äù, and it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre going to face on pretty much every project you ever work on. That doesn‚Äôt mean planning ahead is a bad idea ‚Äì as Winston Churchill said, ‚Äúthose who plan do better than those who do not plan, even though they rarely stick to their plan.‚Äù</p><p>So, we‚Äôre not sticking to the plan; we‚Äôre adding an important new feature that will force you to rethink the way you‚Äôve built your app, will hopefully lead you to think about how you structured your code, and also give you practice in a technique that you ought to be thoroughly familiar with by now: SwiftData.</p><p>Yes, your job today is to expand your app so that it uses SwiftData. Your boss just emailed you to say the app is great, but once the JSON has been fetched they really want it to work <em>offline</em>. This means you need to use SwiftData to store the information you download, then use your SwiftData models to display the views you designed ‚Äì you should only fetch the data once.</p><p>The end result will hopefully be the same as if I had given you the task all at once, but segmenting it in two like this hopefully makes it seem more within reach, while also giving you the chance to think about how well you structured your code to be adaptable as change requests come in.</p><h3 id="important-please-read" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#important-please-read"><span>Important: please read!</span></a></h3><p><strong>This is a hard challenge.</strong> I‚Äôm going to give you a small tip below, and some of you might think ‚Äútips?
