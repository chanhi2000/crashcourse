There are more projects to cover, but as F1 racer Sebastian Vettel once said, ‚Äúsometimes you need to press pause to let everything sink in.‚Äù</p><p>Today is your chance to press pause and let SwiftUI sink in. Complete the review, take the challenges, and, if you need to, go back to previous consolidation day challenges and work on them.</p><p>So many people email me with questions like ‚Äúhow fast can I learn app development?‚Äù and honestly I feel sorry for them. <em>You can‚Äôt learn when you rush</em>. The two goals are incompatible with your brain. Focused learning is when we actively consume information through studying and that‚Äôs really important, but <em>diffuse</em> learning is when we stop studying and let our brain passively make connections between what we already studied. Taking a break, sleeping, or working on something else for a while are all important parts of the process.</p><p>So, if you‚Äôre keen to rush ahead to tomorrow‚Äôs new project, please follow Vettel‚Äôs advice: press pause and let everything sink in.</p><p><strong>Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 7, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.</strong></p><h3 id="iexpense-wrap-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#iexpense-wrap-up"><span>iExpense: Wrap up</span></a></h3>',7),v={class:"hint-container details"},_=e("summary",null,"iExpense: Wrap up",-1),x=p('<p>Although the app we were building wasn‚Äôt itself difficult, <em>getting</em> there took quite a bit of learning ‚Äì we had to cover <code>UserDefaults</code>, <code>Codable</code>, <code>sheet()</code>, <code>onDelete()</code>, <code>@StateObject</code>, and more. Some of those things ‚Äì particularly <code>UserDefaults</code> and <code>Codable</code> ‚Äì have only been introduced at a high level in this project, which is intentional; we‚Äôll be getting into them more later on.</p><p>Now that your SwiftUI skills are coming along, I hope you noticed we were able to skip past some parts with very little explanation.
