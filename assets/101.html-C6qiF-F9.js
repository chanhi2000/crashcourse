I expect you‚Äôre feeling a number of different things right now.</p><p>I‚Äôd like to think that you‚Äôre proud of all the work you put in. Doing 100 days of coding might have sounded easy in the first week or so, but by week eight you probably had to work harder and harder to motivate yourself.</p><p>I expect you feel tired, both physically but also mentally. Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt blame you if you wanted a week or two away from Swift. Trust me: you‚Äôve earned it!</p><p>I hope you feel inspired for the future. This course was designed to expose you to a range of SwiftUI features in a hands-on way, so you‚Äôve learned about all the major features of SwiftUI alongside Core Image, MapKit, and more. You won‚Äôt build an app that uses <em>all</em> those things, but everyone will take different things from the course and use those experiences to build their own dream app.</p><p>However, one thing you‚Äôre almost certainly feeling is a weird sense of emptiness. For the last 100 days you‚Äôve been taking an hour or more out of your day to work on Swift ‚Äì you‚Äôve spent so long listening to my voice ramble on about <code>@State</code> properties and similar, but now that‚Äôs all finished, so there‚Äôs a ‚Äú100 Days of SwiftUI‚Äù-shaped hole in your life.</p><p>The natural question your brain asks is ‚Äúwhat now?‚Äù</p><p>Well, I have a few suggestions.</p><h3 id="start-building-your-portfolio" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#start-building-your-portfolio"><span>Start building your portfolio</span></a></h3><p>In the 100 Days of SwiftUI you‚Äôve seen a wide range of apps, tools, and techniques ‚Äì I‚Äôve done my very best to show you what‚Äôs out there, and give you maximum exposure to different coding styles, different Apple frameworks, and more.</p><p>But when you want to get a job ‚Äì when you want to turn your skills into a career ‚Äì the most important thing you can do is build a portfolio of your work, that shows you‚Äôre able to build professional-quality apps that would be at home at any company.</p><p>Well, I have the perfect course for you: it‚Äôs called <strong>The Ultimate Portfolio App</strong>, and it walks you through building one complete SwiftUI app that‚Äôs packed with the kinds of things employers look for, including:</p><ul><li>Thoughtful code architecture</li><li>Unit tests and UI tests</li><li>Localization and accessibility</li><li>Code linting and documentation</li></ul><p>Plus it uses a wide range of Apple‚Äôs powerhouse frameworks, including Core Data and iCloud, in-app purchases, notifications, Spotlight, Shortcuts, haptics, widgets, and more, and your finished app works on iOS, macOS, and beyond.</p><p>Best of all, the Ultimate Portfolio App course comes as part of Hacking with Swift+, my subscription tutorial service, which means every installment comes as both a video and article, and you also get over 200 other tutorials on a range of more advanced topics ‚Äì it‚Äôs the fastest way to level up your Swift skills.</p><h3 id="support-free-learning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#support-free-learning"><span>Support free learning</span></a></h3><p>First, if this course was useful to you I‚Äôd like you to consider either subscribing to my tutorials or buying one of my books. I‚Äôve provided everything here ‚Äì all the daily introductions, all the videos, all the tests, and more ‚Äì free of charge, because I want to help folks reach their goals regardless of their income.</p><p>The best place for that is at <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacking with Swift+</a>, which offers the widest range of tutorials, plus monthly live streams, and more.</p><p>Alternatively, you could buy a book from me:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/pro-swiftui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro SwiftUI</a> takes your SwiftUI skills to the next level with deeper learning and advanced effects.</li><li><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/pro-swiftui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Swift</a> teaches you advanced Swift skills.</li><li><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/pro-swiftui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift Design Patterns</a> teaches you advanced iOS app architecture.</li><li><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/pro-swiftui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Swift</a> teaches you how to write tests to make your code more stable.</li><li><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/pro-swiftui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift Codin Challengesg</a> gives you a range of coding problems to help you pass job interviews.</li></ul><h3 id="ship-an-app" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ship-an-app"><span>Ship an app</span></a></h3><p>It‚Äôs one thing to code an app but quite another to <em>ship</em> an app. You need to spend far more time finding and fixing bugs, testing on various devices, and of course taking screenshots, writing descriptions, and more.</p><p>So, for all the apps you‚Äôve built so far ‚Äì including all the challenges that you wrote yourself ‚Äì you‚Äôve done the first 90% of the work, but if you want <em>real</em> experience it‚Äôs time to do the second 90% of the work and actually <em>ship</em> the app.</p><h3 id="and-finally" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#and-finally"><span>And finally‚Ä¶</span></a></h3><p>Throughout these 100 days I‚Äôve tried to inspire you, make you think, and perhaps even make you laugh with a range of quotes from people in our industry and beyond.</p><p>Today I‚Äôd like to sign off with some words from Ralph Waldo Emerson: ‚ÄúWhat lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you.‚Äù</p><p>I‚Äôve always said that programming is an art, and that you shouldn‚Äôt spend all your time sharpening your pencil when you should be drawing. Well, now it‚Äôs time for the sharpening to stop and the drawing to begin ‚Äì I hope you enjoy it, I hope you reach your goals, and I hope you find great success with SwiftUI!</p><hr>',28);function v(r,S){const o=n("router-link"),s=n("VPCard");return f(),p("div",null,[e("h1",g,[e("a",y,[e("span",null,h(r.$frontmatter.title)+" Í¥ÄÎ†®",1)])]),e("nav",m,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(o,{to:"#what-now"},{default:a(()=>[i("What now?")]),_:1}),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t(o,{to:"#start-building-your-portfolio"},{default:a(()=>[i("Start building your portfolio")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(o,{to:"#support-free-learning"},{default:a(()=>[i("Support free learning")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(o,{to:"#ship-an-app"},{default:a(()=>[i("Ship an app")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[t(o,{to:"#and-finally"},{default:a(()=>[i("And finally‚Ä¶")]),_:1})])])])])]),b,t(s,u(d({title:"100 Days of SwiftUI -Epilog",desc:"What now?",link:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/101",logo:"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/favicon.svg",background:"rgba(54,94,226,0.2)"})),null,16),k])}const x=l(w,[["render",v],["__file","101.html.vue"]]),U=JSON.parse('{"path":"/swift/100-days-of-swiftui/101.html","title":"Epilog","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Epilog","description":"100 Days of SwiftUI > Epilog","category":["Swift"],"tag":["crashcourse","paul-hudson","swift","swiftui","hacking-with-swift","xcode","appstore"],"head":[[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"100 Days of SwiftUI > Epilog"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Epilog"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swiftui/101.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/crashcourse/crashcourse/swift/100-days-of-swiftui/101.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ü•ÅCrashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Epilog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"100 Days of SwiftUI > Epilog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"crashcourse"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"paul-hudson"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swiftui"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"hacking-with-swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"xcode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"appstore"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Epilog\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-10-03T01:20:13.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"What now?","slug":"what-now","link":"#what-now","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Start building your portfolio","slug":"start-building-your-portfolio","link":"#start-building-your-portfolio","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Support free learning","slug":"support-free-learning","link":"#support-free-learning","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Ship an app","slug":"ship-an-app","link":"#ship-an-app","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"And finally‚Ä¶","slug":"and-finally","link":"#and-finally","children":[]}]}],"git":{"createdTime":1710213771000,"updatedTime":1727918413000,"contributors":[{"name":"chanhi2000","email":"chanhi2000@gmail.com","commits":6}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":3.21,"words":964},"filePathRelative":"swift/100-days-of-swiftui/101.md","localizedDate":"2024ÎÖÑ 3Ïõî 12Ïùº","excerpt":"\\n\\n<hr>\\n"}');export{x as comp,U as data};
