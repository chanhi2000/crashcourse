Most importantly, in play children <em>learn how to learn.</em>” That’s huge, if you stop and think about it: play helps teach kids the thing they are working with, but also deepens in them the concepts underlying all of learning itself.</p><p>Of course, play doesn’t apply just to kids – as George Bernard Shaw said, “we don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.” And so today’s second consolidation day is geared around giving you the space and time to play around with Core Graphics to see what you can do.</p><p>I’ve created a special Swift playground that walks you through a variety of Core Graphics techniques. However, I’ve made two versions, and it’s important you choose the right one.</p><p><strong>Today you should work through my Learn Core Graphics playground, either in Swift Playgrounds (preferred) or Xcode.</strong></p><p>Remember: experimentation like this is a powerful way to learn Core Graphics, but also learning how to learn in general. Enjoy it!</p><h3 id="if-you-have-an-ipad" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#if-you-have-an-ipad"><span>If you have an iPad</span></a></h3><p>Please install Apple’s “Swift Playgrounds” app from the App Store. It’s free, and allows you to experience my Core Graphics playground in its fullest.</p><p>Once you have Swift Playgrounds installed on your iPad, visit <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/playgrounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.hackingwithswift.com/playgrounds</a> on your iPad and click the big green “CLICK TO SUBSCRIBE” button.
