As Saint Steve said, technology alone is not enough – you won’t build something truly great just by shipping a thin layer over Apple’s APIs.</p><p>It’s easy to think to yourself, “what can I make that’s different from everything else?” What you <em>ought</em> to be thinking is “what unique perspective does my background and experience give me that lets me build a fresh take on an existing idea?” In 2015 (seven years after the App Store launched) Microsoft spent north of $100 million acquiring Wonderlist, which was – shock! – a to do list app.</p><p>What I’m saying is that your idea doesn’t need to be special, and really your code doesn’t need to be that special either. Because what matters – the part that makes our heart sing – is where you blend all that with what makes you <em>you</em>. If you’ve used 10 to do apps and none quite scratch the itch you have, it’s time for you to make your own. And with over a billion people out there using iOS, you’ll find that there are hundreds of thousands of people that have exactly that same itch, and would happily hand over a buck or two for your solution.</p><p>Whether your app idea ends up building on multipeer networking, iBeacons, Core Image, or more – it doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’re giving yourself the skills you need to build the app of your dreams, and you should be darned proud of yourself.</p><p><strong>Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 25, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.</strong></p><h3 id="wrap-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wrap-up"><span>Wrap up</span></a></h3>',8),_={class:"hint-container details"},D=e("summary",null,"Wrap up",-1),S=l('<p>Multipeer connectivity is something that used to be awfully hard, but in iOS it&#39;s less than 150 lines of code to produce this entire app – and over half of that is code for the collection view and the image picker!</p><p>The advantage it has compared to traditional data sharing over Wi-Fi is that multipeer can use an existing Wi-Fi network, or can silently create a new Wi-Fi network or even a Bluetooth network depending on what&#39;s available.
