But today we recognize that animation helps guide users through state changes in our app: when they delete an email it moved into the trash can, so they can see that it’s gone and know where to go if they want it back.</p><p>John Maeda, design lead at Automattic (the company behind Wordpress), put this rather succinctly: “Design used to be the seasoning you’d sprinkle on for taste; now it’s the flour you need at the start of the recipe.” That means we need to be thinking about animation at the early stages of our app – deciding how the user should interact with everything we show them needs to be at the core of our design.</p><p>Today is all about bringing your user interfaces to life with movement, scaling, rotation, and more. We’ll be working in a sandbox, but you can use these principles anywhere!</p><p><strong>Today you have three topics to work through, and you’ll learn about <code>animate(withDuration:)</code>, <code>CGAffineTransform</code>, <code>alpha</code>, and more.</strong></p><h3 id="setting-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#setting-up"><span>Setting up</span></a></h3>',7),T={class:"hint-container details"},A=n("summary",null,"Setting up",-1),x=n("p",null,"It's time to introduce one of the most important techniques in iOS development: animation.

However, it has put us in a position where we can start dabbling with animations. But first, here&#39;s a breakdown of the code:</p><ul><li>When the method begins, we hide the <code>sender</code> button so that our animations don&#39;t collide; it gets unhidden in the completion closure of the animation.</li><li>We call <code>animate(withDuration:)</code> with a duration of 1 second, no delay, and no interesting options.</li><li>For the <code>animations</code> closure we <em>don’t</em> need to use <code>[weak self]</code> because there’s no risk of strong reference cycles here – the closures passed to <code>animate(withDuration:)</code> method will be used once then thrown away.</li><li>We switch using the value of <code>self.currentAnimation</code>. We need to use <code>self</code> to make the closure capture clear, remember. This <code>switch/case</code> does nothing yet, because both possible cases just call <code>break</code>.</li><li>We use trailing closure syntax to provide our completion closure. This will be called when the animation completes, and its <code>finished</code> value will be true if the animations completed fully.</li><li>As I said, the completion closure unhides the <code>sender</code> button so it can be tapped again.</li><li>After the <code>animate(withDuration:)</code> call, we have the old code to modify and wrap <code>currentAnimation</code>.</li></ul><p>If you run the app now and tap the button, you&#39;ll notice it doesn&#39;t actually hide and show as you might expect. This is because UIKit detects that no animation has taken place, so it calls the completion closure straight away.</p>`,8),F=n("h3",{id:"transform-cgaffinetransform",tabindex:"-1"},[n("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#transform-cgaffinetransform"},[n("span",null,[s("Transform: "),n("code",null,"CGAffineTransform")])])],-1),X={class:"hint-container details"},O=n("summary",null,"Transform: CGAffineTransform",-1),K=r(`<p>Our code now has the perfect structure in place to let us dabble with animations freely, so it&#39;s time to learn about <code>CGAffineTransform</code>. This is a structure that represents a specific kind of transform that we can apply to any <code>UIView</code> object or subclass.</p><p>Unless you&#39;re into mathematics, affine transforms can seem like a black art. But Apple does provide some great helper functions to make it easier: there are functions to scale up a view, functions to rotate, functions to move, and functions to reset back to default.</p><p>All of these functions return a <code>CGAffineTransform</code> value that you can put into a view&#39;s <code>transform</code> property to apply it. As we&#39;ll be doing this inside an animation block, the transform will automatically be animated. This illustrates one of the many powerful things of Core Animation: you tell it what you want to happen, and it calculates all the intermediary states automatically.</p><p>Let&#39;s start with something simple: when we&#39;re at <code>currentAnimation</code> value 0, we want to make the view 2x its default size.

This accepts one parameter, which is the amount in radians you want to rotate. There are three catches to using this function:</p><ol><li>You need to provide the value in radians specified as a <code>CGFloat</code>. This usually isn&#39;t a problem – if you type 1.0 in there, Swift is smart enough to make that a <code>CGFloat</code> automatically. If you want to use a value like pi, use <code>CGFloat.pi</code>.</li><li>Core Animation will always take the shortest route to make the rotation work. So, if your object is straight and you rotate to 90 degrees (radians: half of pi), it will rotate clockwise. If your object is straight and you rotate to 270 degrees (radians: pi + half of pi) it will rotate counter-clockwise because it&#39;s the smallest possible animation.</li><li>A consequence of the second catch is that if you try to rotate 360 degrees (radians: pi times 2), Core Animation will calculate the shortest rotation to be &quot;just don&#39;t move, because we&#39;re already there.&quot; The same goes for values over 360, for example if you try to rotate 540 degrees (one and a half full rotations), you&#39;ll end up with just a 180-degree rotation.
