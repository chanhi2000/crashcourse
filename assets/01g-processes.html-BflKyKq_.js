Controlling Terminal</span></a></h2><p>We discussed how there is a TTY field in the ps output. The TTY is the terminal that executed the command.</p><p>There are two types of terminals, regular <strong>terminal devices</strong> and <strong>pseudoterminal devices</strong>. A regular terminal device is a native terminal device that you can type into and send output to your system, this sounds like the terminal application you&#39;ve been launching to get to your shell, but it&#39;s not.</p><p>We&#39;re gonna segue so you can see this action, go ahead and type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>F1</kbd> to get into TTY1 (the first virtual console), you&#39;ll notice how you don&#39;t have anything except the terminal, no graphics, etc. This is considered a regular terminal device, you can exit this with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>F7</kbd>.</p>`,21),_=e("code",null,"pts/*",-1),T=i(`<p>Ok, now circling back to the controlling terminal, processes are usually bound to a controlling terminal. For example, if you were running a program on your shell window such as find and you closed the window, your process would also go with it.</p><p>There are processes such as daemon processes, which are special processes that are essentially keeping the system running. They often start at system boot and usually get terminated when the system is shutdown. They run in the background and since we don&#39;t want these special processes to get terminated they are not bound to a controlling terminal. In the ps output, the TTY is listed as a <code>?</code> meaning it does not have a controlling terminal.</p><p>Look at your <code>ps</code> output and list all the unique TTY values.</p><hr><h2 id="_3-process-details" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-process-details"><span>3. Process Details</span></a></h2><p>Before we get into more practical applications of processes, we have to first understand what they are and how they work. This part can get confusing since we are diving into the nitty gritty, so feel free to come back to this lesson if you don&#39;t want to learn about it now.</p><p>A process like we said before is a running program on the system, more precisely it&#39;s the system allocating memory, CPU, I/O to make the program run. A process is an instance of a running program, go ahead and open 3 terminal windows, in two windows, run the <code>cat</code> command without passing any options (the cat process will stay open as a process because it expects stdin). Now in the third window run: <code>ps aux | grep cat</code>. You&#39;ll see that there are two processes for <code>cat</code>, even though they are calling the same program.</p><p>The kernel is in charge of processes, when we run a program the kernel loads up the code of the program in memory, determines and allocates resources and then keeps tabs on each process, it knows:</p><ul><li>The status of the process</li><li>The resources the process is using and receives</li><li>The process owner</li><li>Signal handling (more on that later)</li><li>And basically everything else</li></ul><p>All processes are trying to get a taste of that sweet resource pie, it&#39;s the kernel&#39;s job to make sure that processes get the right amount of resources depending on process demands. When a process ends, the resources it used are now freed up for other processes.</p><hr><h2 id="_4-process-creation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-process-creation"><span>4. Process Creation</span></a></h2><p>Again this lesson and the next are purely information to let you see what&#39;s under the hood, feel free to circle back to this once you&#39;ve worked with processes a bit more.</p><p>When a new process is created, an existing process basically clones itself using something called the fork system call (system calls will be discussed very far into the future). The fork system call creates a mostly identical child process, this child process takes on a new process ID (PID) and the original process becomes its parent process and has something called a parent process ID <strong>PPID</strong>. Afterwards, the child process can either continue to use the same program its parent was using before or more often use the execve system call to launch up a new program. This system call destroys the memory management that the kernel put into place for that process and sets up new ones for the new program.</p><p>We can see this in action:</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token function">ps</span> l</span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>The <code>l</code> option gives us a &quot;long format&quot; or even more detailed view of our running processes. You&#39;ll see a column labelled <strong>PPID</strong>, this is the parent ID. Now look at your terminal, you&#39;ll see a process running that is your shell, so on my system I have a process running bash. Now remember when you ran the ps l command, you were running it from the process that was running bash. Now you&#39;ll see that the <strong>PID</strong> of the bash shell is the <strong>PPID</strong> of the <code>ps l</code> command.</p><p>So if every process has to have a parent and they are just forks of each other, there must be a mother of all processes right? You are correct, when the system boots up, the kernels creates a process called <code>init</code>, it has a PID of 1. The init process can&#39;t be terminated unless the system shuts down. It runs with root privileges and runs many processes that keep the system running. We will take a closer look at init in the system bootup course, for now just know it is the process that spawns all other processes.</p><hr><h2 id="_5-process-termination" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-process-termination"><span>5. Process Termination</span></a></h2><p>Now that we know what goes on when a process gets created, what is happening when we don&#39;t need it anymore? Be forewarned, sometimes Linux can get a little dark...</p><p>A process can exit using the <code>_exit</code> system call, this will free up the resources that process was using for reallocation. So when a process is ready to terminate, it lets the kernel know why it&#39;s terminating with something called a termination status. Most commonly a status of 0 means that the process succeeded. However, that&#39;s not enough to completely terminate a process. The parent process has to acknowledge the termination of the child process by using the wait system call and what this does is it checks the termination status of the child process. I know it&#39;s gruesome to think about, but the wait call is a necessity, after all what parent wouldn&#39;t want to know how their child died?</p><p>There is another way to terminate a process and that involves using signals, which we will discuss soon.</p><h3 id="orphan-processes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#orphan-processes"><span>Orphan Processes</span></a></h3><p>When a parent process dies before a child process, the kernel knows that it&#39;s not going to get a wait call, so instead it makes these processes &quot;orphans&quot; and puts them under the care of init (remember mother of all processes). Init will eventually perform the wait system call for these orphans so they can die.</p><h3 id="zombie-processes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#zombie-processes"><span>Zombie Processes</span></a></h3><p>What happens when a child terminates and the parent process hasn&#39;t called wait yet? We still want to be able to see how a child process terminated, so even though the child process finished, the kernel turns the child process into a zombie process. The resources the child process used are still freed up for other processes, however there is still an entry in the process table for this zombie. Zombie processes also cannot be killed, since they are technically &quot;dead&quot;, so you can&#39;t use signals to kill them. Eventually if the parent process calls the wait system call, the zombie will disappear, this is known as &quot;reaping&quot;. If the parent doesn&#39;t perform a wait call, init will adopt the zombie and automatically perform wait and remove the zombie. It can be a bad thing to have too many zombie processes, since they take up space on the process table, if it fills up it will prevent other processes from running.</p><hr><h2 id="_6-signals" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-signals"><span>6.

When a signal is delivered, a process can do a multitude of things:</p><ul><li>Ignore the signal</li><li>&quot;Catch&quot; the signal and perform a specific handler routine</li><li>Process can be terminated, as opposed to the normal exit system call</li><li>Block the signal, depending on the signal mask</li></ul><h3 id="common-signals" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#common-signals"><span>Common signals</span></a></h3><p>Each signal is defined by integers with symbolic names that are in the form of SIGxxx.

Then they pause for milliseconds and another process gets a little time slice. By default, process scheduling happens in this round-robin fashion. Every process gets enough time slices until it&#39;s finished processing. The kernel handles all of these switching of processes and it does a pretty good job at it most of the time.</p><p>Processes aren&#39;t able to decide when and how long they get CPU time, if all processes behaved normally they would each (roughly) get an equal amount of CPU time. However, there is a way to influence the kernel&#39;s process scheduling algorithm with a nice value. Niceness is a pretty weird name, but what it means is that processes have a number to determine their priority for the CPU. A high number means the process is nice and has a lower priority for the CPU and a low or negative number means the process is not very nice and it wants to get as much of the CPU as possible.</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre><code><span class="line"><span class="token function">top</span></span>
